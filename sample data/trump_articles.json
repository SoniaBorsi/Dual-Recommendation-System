        "excerpt": "Less than two weeks after Trump's victory, the tech baron is clashing with multiple members of his team.",
        "summary": "Elon Musk is starting to clash with Donald Trump's team on some of the president-elect's key issues, especially tariffs.\nThe Washington Post reports that Musk is trying to persuade Trump regarding Cabinet picks and economic policy, drawing the ire of the president-elect's other advisers. On Saturday, Musk praised Argentine President Javier Milei in a post on X for cutting tariffs in his country. The central pillar of Trump's economic program is raising tariffs.\nIn another post later on Saturday, Musk endorsed Howard Lutnick, co-chair of Trump's transition team and CEO of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, for the post of treasury secretary over hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, who is in the running for the position. Both posts from Musk aren't going over well with the rest of Trump's team.\n'People are not happy,' one person in contact with campaign officials told the Post anonymously. Musk's posts seemed to reflect that the tech CEO and world's richest man was acting like a 'co-president' and beginning to overstep his role, the person added.\nMusk's praise of Lutnick, for example, came before any public statements from the campaign or any announcements from Trump. Musk also called on his followers to weigh in with their opinion on the Cabinet position, which might send a message that he thinks Trump needs some convincing\u2014or pressure.\nThere is also friction between Musk and Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn, with Axios reporting that the tech mogul thinks Epshteyn, who has pushed for appointments such as Matt Gaetz as attorney general, has too much influence over Trump's choices. Musk has questioned the qualifications of Epshteyn's preferred candidates, irking the longtime Trump adviser.\nThese disagreements reportedly came to a head last Wednesday at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, where Musk and Epshteyn had an angry exchange at a dinner table. Musk even accused Epshteyn of leaking details about the Trump transition to the media, which Epshteyn denied.\nIf Musk gets into a turf war with other members of Trump's team as Trump's new presidential administration takes shape, he already has a big advantage. The tech CEO pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump's campaign, and the president-elect has already included Musk in many important meetings, as well as a phone call to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy just after the election. Last week, Musk even took part in a private meeting with Iran's ambassador to the United Nations in New York, raising questions of whether it was on Trump's orders.\nMusk has been photographed with members of Trump's family too, making it look like he has become part of Mar-a-Lago's furniture and irking Trump's advisers and staff. It seems that the world's richest man has bought his way into Trump's inner circle and won't be leaving for the foreseeable future.",

But this is not a simmering anger, there was a major outburst at the dinner table at Mar-a-Lago when Musk countered\nBoris Epshteyn\n-- a top adviser who reportedly pushed contentious Matt Gaetz for attorney general.\nAxios cited sources who confirmed that Epshteyn has been bristling at Elon Musk questioning the qualification of Epshteyn's candidates. \"At one point during what the sources describe as a 'massive blowup' and a 'huge explosion', Musk accused Epshteyn of leaking details of Trump's transition -- including personnel picks -- to the media. Epshteyn responded by telling Musk that he didn't know what he was talking about,\" Axios reported.\n'It was not a surprise'\nTo Trump's senior staffers, the outburst was not a surprise as tensions have been brewing at transition meetings. And given Trump's love to pit his confidantes against each other, many people saw this coming. Epshteyn \u2014 who coordinated the legal defense in Trump's criminal cases \u2014 was a big influence in Trump's presidential appointments last week, Axios reported. Musk is making a late push for Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick to be treasury secretary.\nElon Musk is always there, First-buddy, uncle\nMany in Donald Trump's inner circle, especially Trump's family members, like having Elon Musk around. Vice president-elect JD Vance is one of them apart from Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy, conservative commentator Tucker Carlson. Elon Musk was included in Donald Trump's family photo, Trump's granddaughter Kai called him uncle and Elon Musk accepted his new unofficial position as 'First Buddy' -- and then there is his official position as co-chief of the Department of Government Efficiency, which he will be heading with Vivek Ramaswamy and it is not part of the government.\nBut Musk's involvement in the transition process has begun to wear on people who have been in Trump's inner circle longer than he has and who see him as overstepping his role in the transition, NBC reported earlier.",

        "summary": "Donald Trump has touted his victory in the presidential race against Vice President Kamala Harris as \"powerful,\" but some experts say his mandate is small.\nTrump defeated Harris in the presidential race earlier this month, sweeping every key battleground state and narrowly winning the popular vote, setting him up to return to the White House in January. Trump has vowed to enact sweeping conservative policies during his second term, describing his win as an \"unprecedented and powerful mandate\" in his victory speech.\nTrump has said he would push for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants on his first day in office, implement tariffs aimed at stopping companies from relocating jobs overseas and appoint loyalists to key cabinet posts.\nHis supporters point to his popular vote victory and the Republicans' control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate as proof of the mandate. Trump is the first Republican to win the popular vote since George W. Bush in 2004, and this is the first time the GOP has held a trifecta since 2016.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump speaks in Washington, D.C., on November 13, 2024.

Some political experts are warning that Trump's mandate may not be as large as he says.\nAllison Robbert-Pool/Getty Images\nRepublicans' full control of the federal government means they will have the authority to enact conservative policies over the next four years, but some political experts warn that Trump may be overstating his mandate.\nTrump held a 1.7-point lead in the popular vote as of Monday morning, according to The New York Times. That is smaller than former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2.1 point popular vote win in 2016 and less than half of President Joe Biden's 4.5 point win in 2020.\nCNN's senior data reporter Harry Enten made the case Monday morning that, while Trump had a \"very wide\" win, it was \"not particularly deep\" as the overall numbers pointed to a close election.\n\"The case that Trump's mandate isn't all that, look, if you look historically speaking, Donald Trump is now under 50 percent in the national popular vote. Barely under 50 percent, but he is under 50 percent,\" Enten said.\nEnten noted that Trump's popular vote is only the 44th strongest victory in the 51 presidential elections held in the U.S. since 1824.\n\"That isn't exactly strong. Some might argue that is weak, weak, weak, in the words of Tony Blair. In fact, his popular vote win at this point is the weakest going all the way back, you have to go all the way back to 2000, to find a smaller popular vote victory than Donald Trump currently has,\" he said. \"So, yeah, Trump has won the popular vote. But it ain't all that.\"\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's transition team for comment via email.\nEnten also pointed out that Trump had weak coattails as Democrats won four Senate races in states Trump won\u2014Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin. Meanwhile, House Republicans are on track to hold a \"historically small minority.\"\nRepublicans are currently leading 221 races, while Democrats are leading 214. Only a handful of these races have not been called.\n\"You have to go all the way back before there were 50 states in the union to find a smaller majority for the incoming House majority,\" he said.\nOthers, however, have argued that Trump does have a large mandate.\n\"What these Democrats refuse to admit is that Donald Trump is coming back to Washington, D.C., with a mandate from the American people and is entitled to have his cabinet around him that he chooses,\" said Trump's 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Fox News.\nHe added that Trump's \"mandate also allowed him to make the U.S. Senate a Republican majority,\" saying his victories in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania carried GOP candidates across the finish line.\nLaurence Tribe, Harvard law professor and legal analyst, also cast doubt on the size of Trump's mandate in a post to X (formerly Twitter).\n\"Don't buy into the illusion that Trump has a mandate to trample the rule of law or ignore the Constitution. He does not. Under 1/3 of eligible voters picked Trump. That is no mandate but a narrow victory,\" he wrote.\nHowever, veteran Democratic strategist David Axelrod wrote earlier in November that Trump can claim a mandate, but noted he should \"understand what that mandate was about.\"\n\"It was about boosting working people and dealing with the border, not appointing extremists to seek vengeance on his opponents,\" he wrote on X.",

        "summary": "A former employee of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has cast doubt on recent rumblings that President-elect Donald Trump could consider pardoning the beleaguered music mogul once he gets into office.\nBad Boy Records founder Combs was arrested and charged on September 16, in a three-count indictment, with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing, and has been denied bail on multiple occasions.\nCombs' spokespeople have repeatedly pointed Newsweek to the following statement: \"We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court.\"\nIn the several weeks since Combs has been placed in custody ahead of his May 2025 trial date, Trump has won the presidential election, giving him a second term in the White House. As the U.S. anticipates Trump's return to power from January, speculation has already mounted over whether the Republican will pardon Combs.\n(Left) Donald Trump pictured on November 14, 2024 (Right) Sean \"Diddy\" Combs on March 4, 2018.

He was going against Donald Trump.\"\nDeal, who has written books about his time working for Combs, added that Trump \"is [as] petty as 50 Cent,\" referring to the rapper and businessman who has been highly critical of Combs in the months since allegations against him were made public.\nWith Combs' past comments on Trump in mind, Deal opined that the incoming president will likely say, \"Why should I help this mother****** when he talks s*** about me?\"\n\"Everybody was dealing with Donald Trump at one time that was in the music record business and all that stuff like that,\" Deal said, adding that those same people eventually \"flipped\" on Trump as he rose politically.\n\"Donald Trump probably wouldn't p*** on Puff if he was on fire,\" he went on. \"At one point, they was going at him. So why would he help? ... I don't believe he's gonna help him. Not at all.\"\nNewsweek has contacted representatives of Trump and Combs via email for comment.\nTrump, Combs Over the Years\nAs with a host of other celebrities, Trump and Combs were photographed together at various events over the years. The New York Post's Page Six reported in May that Trump was among the celebrities featured in an invitation to Combs' 29th birthday party in 1998. In the video invitation, Trump referred to Combs as \"the legendary Puff Daddy.\"\nWhile Trump has made little public comment about their relationship, he did share glowing words on an episode of The Celebrity Apprentice back in 2012. Speaking with then-contestant Aubrey O'Day, Trump said: \"I love Diddy. You know he's a good friend of mine. He's a good guy. Is he a good guy?\"\nO'Day, who was part of girl group Danity Kane, who were initially signed to Combs' Bad Boy Records, declined to answer Trump's question. In the years since, she has been publicly critical of Combs. O'Day also claimed that she had an affair with Donald Trump Jr. after they met on the show.\nCombs has been comparatively more candid in his public statements about the elder Trump.\n(Left to Right) Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Donald Trump, and Melania Trump, pictured on March 11, 2005, in New York City.

So that's not what we're on. The tomfoolery that's going on in D.C., that's just regular everyday business to black folks. That's not surprising,\" he said.\nBy 2020, as Trump ran for a second term, Combs had become more critical of the then-president, going so far as to support his opponent, Joe Biden.\n\"White men like Trump need to be banished. That way of thinking is real dangerous,\" he said in an interview with radio host Charlamagne tha God, per CNN.\n\"When you look at it, we don't have no choice. Say what you want about Biden, I can't say I love the pick either. But we've got to get him in office, and then we've got to hold him accountable,\" Combs added.\nBefore leaving office in 2021, Donald Trump he commuted rapper Kodak Black's sentence and pardoned hip-hop star Lil Wayne over their separate firearms offenses. Both stars have publicly expressed support for Donald Trump.",

In December 2016, Scarborough told Politico that they \"talk to Trump a few times a week.\"\nJoe Scarborough criticizes MSNBC for taking 'Morning Joe' off-air Monday: 'Very disappointed'\nBut their relationship took a turn after Trump assumed office as the MSNBC hosts increasingly took issue with his actions as president and as Trump attacked the \"crazy\" and \"psycho\" hosts on social media. In a controversial 2017 tweet, Trump wrote that Brzezinski \"was bleeding badly from a face-lift\" when she came to Mar-a-Lago the previous year.\nJimmy Kimmel, more late-night hosts 'shocked' by Trump Cabinet picks: 'Goblins and weirdos'\nBrzezinski told viewers on Monday that although she and Scarborough have \"deep concerns about President Trump's actions and words,\" nearly 80 million Americans voted for him, so it's \"time to do something different, and that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump, but also talking with him.\" She added that they told Trump they will continue to \"push back hard\" on him when appropriate.\n\"Don't be mistaken: We're not here to defend or normalize Donald Trump,\" Scarborough said. \"We're here to report on him, and to hopefully provide you insights that are going to better equip all of us in understanding these deeply unsettling times.\"\nScarborough previously said that Americans who vote for Trump this year would be \"knowingly voting for a fascist\" and \"a racist.\" He also said on \"Morning Joe\" that Trump is a threat to democracy and the 2024 election would determine whether \"Madisonian democracy survives.\"",

        "summary": "A longtime Donald Trump adviser and Elon Musk had a 'massive blowup' in front of Mar-a-Lago guests last week, the latest sign of 'tensions' between the men.\nThe incident broke out after a 'heated discussion' led Musk to accuse Boris Epshteyn of leaking Trump's cabinet picks to the media, Axios reported. Epshteyn is said to have responded by telling Musk he 'didn't know what he was talking about.'\nThat encounter, also described as being a 'huge explosion,' reportedly occurred at a dinner table inside Trump's club. The president-elect's transition team and Musk declined to comment to Axios. Epshteyn, the longtime coordinator of Trump's legal defense, referred the website to Trump's transition team.\nAxios' report did specify if Trump was present for the argument.\nThose who've hung around Mar-a-Lago since Election Day weren't surprised by Musk and Epshteyn's beef. Axios' sources said Trump advisers and confidants saw 'tensions between them bubble up during the transition meetings.'\nSpecifically, Axios reported that Epshteyn has 'bristled' at Musk's questioning of the qualifications for his preferred cabinet candidates.\nEpshteyn, 42, has been a close adviser to Trump since his 2016 campaign. He's reportedly had a heavy hand in advising Trump's appointments, which included the polarizing pick of Matt Gaetz for attorney general. Musk, a 53-year-old MAGA newcomer who pumped $119 million into the president-elect's campaign, is also said to have Trump's ear regarding appointments.\nMusk has recently pushed to have Trump's transition co-chair, Howard Lutnick, be named Treasury secretary over the hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. Both men have been actively vying for the position, which has reportedly left Trump annoyed.\nSources told The New York Times the annoyance stems in part from Lutnick hovering too around Trump too often in recent weeks. Trump is also said to have bristled at Lutnick's performance as transition chief, believing he may manipulated things for his own personal benefit.\nMusk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr have both publicly threw their weight behind Lutnick to lead the Department of Treasury, but that may do more harm than good for their preferred candidate. Musk's public fight over the role has also irritated Trump and other aides, The Wall Street Journal reported.\nTrumpland insiders told the Financial Times that the president-elect's advisers have sought assurances that they'd commit to Trump's plans to enact significant tariffs\u2014a centerpiece of his economic agenda.",

Bragging about America PAC and X to anyone who will listen.'\nJason Miller, Musk, Stephen Miller, Boris Esphteyn, Natalie Harp and Dan Scavino arrive with Donald Trump at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, days after the election (Getty Images)\nMusk, meanwhile, is set to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy; both have pledged to recommend mass firings and drastic spending cuts across the federal government.\nThe billionaire has also joined meetings with Trump and his advisers discussing Cabinet appointments as well as a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nMusk also stands to benefit from Trump's incoming administration, as his business empire faces regulatory scrutiny under President Joe BIden's administration with ties to Russia and China potentially facing investigations.\nSpaceX has been awarded roughly $16 billion in federal contracts since 2017, according to government records. The company could see a massive boom if Trump commits to a pledge to expand space investments. Trump praised SpaceX at his campaign rallies and committed several minutes to talking about the company and Musk during his election night victory speech.\nThe Independent has requested comment from Musk and Trump's transition team.",

This was deduced after the Federal Aviation Administration issued flight restrictions for the president-elect at the same time and in the same area as Musk's SpaceX launch. Neither Trump nor Musk have commented publicly yet.\nMusk has been a mainstay within the Trump team, spending countless days at Mar-a-Lago by the president-elect's side. As Trump's biggest and most enthusiastic donor he's been rewarded with official leadership of the (mostly fake) Department of Government Efficiency and unofficial direct access to Trump. He has joined important diplomatic phone calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and others. He's also expected to have an outsized role in choosing the next Department of Transportation that will surely benefit his finances as an electric vehicle company CEO.\nThis is all much to the chagrin of Trump's inner circle, as the richest man in the world is constantly contradicting and circumventing them in Trump's ear.

We talked about that a good bit.\n\"And it's going to come as no surprise to anyone who watches this show...that we didn't see eye to eye on a lot of issues and we told him so.\"\nBrzezinski said that the pair had not spoken to Trump since 2020, although she added that Scarborough made a personal call to Trump after he survived his assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania earlier this year.\nScarborough was a registered Republican until Trump took office in 2017 and served as the Republican Congressional representative for Florida's 1st district between 1994 and 2001.\nHe registered as an Independent in 2017 and has since been an outspoken Trump critic on his MSNBC show for the past seven years.\nScarborough has previously accused Trump of \"fascist talk\".\nIn a reference to Trump's comments that undocumented immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country\", and to the Trump family ancestry, Scarborough said: \"Drumpfs came here from Germany when just having a name Drumpf and being from Germany was seen as anti-American and seen as poisoning the bloodstream.\"\n\"And now we're just going full-on Hitler talking about vermin,\" he added.\nBrzezinski addressed the apparent detente with Trump by saying: \"For those asking why we would go speak to the president-elect during such fraught times, especially between us, I guess I would ask back \u2013 why wouldn't we?\n\"Five years of political warfare has deeply divided Washington and the country.\n\"We have been as clear as we know how in expressing our deep concerns about President Trump's actions and words in the coarsening of public debate.\n\"But for nearly 80 million Americans, election denialism, public trials, January 6, were not as important as the issues that moved them to send Donald Trump back to the White House with their vote. Joe and I realize it's time to do something different, and that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump, but also talking with him.\"\nShe added that Trump came across as cheerful, and open to working with Democrats on key issues.\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

The eagle-eyed Clay Travis of KTRH spotted players for the Detroit Lions performing the Trump dance during their blowout victory against the Jacksonville Jaguars. This time, they added Trump's signature golf swing.\nBut it wasn't just the NFL; the Trump Dance also made an appearance at UFC 309. After winning his fight, Jon Jones performed his version of the dance with President-elect Trump in the audience. He then gave Trump his victor's belt.",

        "summary": "A longtime Donald Trump adviser and Elon Musk had a 'massive blowup' in front of Mar-a-Lago guests last week, the latest sign of 'tensions' between the men.\nThe incident broke out after a 'heated discussion' led Musk to accuse Boris Epshteyn of leaking Trump's cabinet picks to the media, Axios reported. Epshteyn is said to have responded by telling Musk he 'didn't know what he was talking about.'\nThat encounter, also described as being a 'huge explosion,' reportedly occurred at a dinner table inside Trump's club. The president-elect's transition team and Musk declined to comment to Axios. Epshteyn, the longtime coordinator of Trump's legal defense, referred the website to Trump's transition team.\nAxios' report did not specify if Trump was present for the argument.\nThose who've hung around Mar-a-Lago since Election Day weren't surprised by Musk and Epshteyn's beef. Axios' sources said Trump advisers and confidants saw 'tensions between them bubble up during the transition meetings.'\nSpecifically, Axios reported that Epshteyn has 'bristled' at Musk's questioning of the qualifications for his preferred cabinet candidates.\nEpshteyn, 42, has been a close adviser to Trump since his 2016 campaign. He's reportedly had a heavy hand in advising Trump's appointments, which included the polarizing pick of Matt Gaetz for attorney general. Musk, a 53-year-old MAGA newcomer who pumped $119 million into the president-elect's campaign, is also said to have Trump's ear regarding appointments.\nMusk has recently pushed to have Trump's transition co-chair, Howard Lutnick, be named Treasury secretary over the hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. Both men have been actively vying for the position, which has reportedly left Trump annoyed.\nSources told The New York Times the annoyance stems in part from Lutnick hovering too around Trump too often in recent weeks. Trump is also said to have bristled at Lutnick's performance as transition chief, believing he may manipulated things for his own personal benefit.\nMusk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr have both publicly threw their weight behind Lutnick to lead the Department of Treasury, but that may do more harm than good for their preferred candidate. Musk's public fight over the role has also irritated Trump and other aides, The Wall Street Journal reported.\nTrumpland insiders told the Financial Times that the president-elect's advisers have sought assurances that they'd commit to Trump's plans to enact significant tariffs\u2014a centerpiece of his economic agenda.",

        "excerpt": "Elon Musk's growing influence in Donald Trump's presidential transition is causing friction within the president-elect's inner circle. Musk and Trump",
        "summary": "Trump's aides and advisers have reportedly clashed over Cabinet picks.\nPresident-elect\nDonald Trump\nannounced Monday his nomination of former Wisconsin Representative and Fox Business News host Sean Duffy as the next US secretary of transportation. If confirmed, Duffy will manage the department responsible for aviation, automotive, rail, transit, and various transportation policies, wielding oversight of a budget close to $110 billion. This appointment would also see him play a critical role in implementing parts of President Joe Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure law from 2021, including the expansion of electric vehicle charging networks.\nDuffy nomination is part of a larger trend as Trump assembles his new administration, prioritizing loyalists for key roles. Unlike his first term, marked by internal divisions and power struggles, Trump appears determined to consolidate his power base and establish a leadership team aligned with his vision for federal governance. While the Republican party holds the Senate majority, some of these appointments are expected to face challenging confirmation processes.\nThe nomination signals Trump's intent to reshape critical areas of federal policy to reflect his administration's priorities, setting a tone of assertive governance as he steps into his second term.\nDriving the news\nMeanwhile, according to an Axios report, Tesla CEO's increasing involvement in Trump's transition has ignited friction within President-elect's inner circle, with a significant flashpoint being a reported confrontation between Musk and\nTrump legal adviser Boris Epshteyn\nover potential Cabinet appointments. The showdown reportedly occurred during a high-profile dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, illustrating the deeper power dynamics at play as Trump assembles his team for a return to the White House in January 2025, the Axios report said.\nWhy it matters\nMusk's newfound influence underscores his evolution from tech billionaire to political power broker. With at least $119 million contributed to Trump's campaign, Musk's presence in Trump's sphere is as strategic as it is significant. His sway in Trump's decision-making has fueled tension among traditional Trump loyalists who view him as an outsider encroaching on established roles. This clash represents not just a battle of personalities but a conflict over competing visions for Trump's next administration.\nZoom in\nSources familiar with the situation revealed that the tension between Musk, Trump's 'first buddy', and Epshteyn came to a head last week in what insiders described as a 'massive blowup' at Mar-a-Lago. During a dinner attended by key advisers, Musk challenged Epshteyn's influence on Trump's picks, accusing him of leaking transition details to the media. Epshteyn responded sharply, dismissing Musk's accusations and insisting they were baseless.\nMusk's concerns reportedly stemmed from Epshteyn's push for specific allies to secure pivotal roles in the new administration, such as Matt Gaetz for attorney general. Musk, on the other hand, has been advocating for more unconventional choices like Howard Lutnick for treasury secretary. The friction highlights a broader divide in Trump's camp: those who support experienced, mainstream Republicans and those who insist on \"America First\" loyalists who embody Trump's disruptive political ethos.\nThe big picture\nThe Musk-Epshteyn clash signals a larger struggle as Trump prepares to step into his second term. Balancing loyalty with competence is a delicate task for the president-elect, whose base remains committed to his populist vision but whose path forward requires figures capable of navigating complex policies and legislative battles.\nMusk's influence, which extends to reshaping policy priorities and advocating for significant federal spending cuts, has been a disruptive force. His involvement marks a new chapter in Trump's inner circle, which has long been dominated by loyalists who share deep, personal ties with Trump and adhere strictly to his agenda.\nAs per the Axios, a few members within Trump's orbit have publicly backed Musk's presence, acknowledging his innovative perspectives. Vice President-elect JD Vance, conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, and Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump, have reportedly found common ground with Musk. Even Trump's granddaughter,\nKai Trump\n, showcased a lighthearted moment by posting a photo with Musk and calling him 'uncle.'\nDespite the reported confrontation, a transition source played down the incident, emphasizing that Musk and Epshteyn had a 'good relationship' and often dined together. This statement seemed intended to project an image of unity within Trump's team amid increasing scrutiny over the transition's internal workings. However, insiders note that Musk's active role has led to discomfort among other key figures, including longtime Trump advisers who view him as overstepping his bounds, the Axios report said.\nBetween the lines\nMusk's involvement has added pressure on Trump to consider Cabinet picks that blend fresh, bold approaches with seasoned expertise. Epshteyn's supporters argue that the choices he promotes offer continuity and loyalty crucial for maintaining the administration's cohesion, especially in light of Trump's contentious relationship with Washington insiders. Meanwhile, Musk's camp suggests that reliance on \"business-as-usual\" candidates risks stalling Trump's agenda.\nThe disagreement over the direction of appointments highlights Trump's broader challenge: solidifying a team that can effectively implement his policies while appealing to the party's broader coalition. Trump's decision to include Musk in a recent call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky further demonstrated Musk's elevated role, despite potential friction with established advisers.\nZoom out\nThe backdrop of this power struggle is Trump's overarching desire to maintain dominance over a circle known for being fiercely competitive. This dynamic has only intensified with the approach of his January 20 inauguration, where assembling a balanced Cabinet could set the tone for his term. Observers within and outside Trump's camp are closely watching whether the president-elect will manage to unify his team around a cohesive vision or if internal rivalries will persist.\nWhat's next\nTrump's transition team faces critical weeks ahead as final Cabinet appointments loom. Musk's ongoing efforts to push for his preferred candidates will likely continue, potentially intensifying the rift with Epshteyn and others aligned with him. The president-elect will need to strike a delicate balance between rewarding loyalty, which has been a hallmark of his leadership style, and integrating influential figures like Musk, whose ideas often push beyond traditional Republican lines.\nThe drama at Mar-a-Lago is emblematic of Trump's signature approach: fostering competition among his advisers to test their resolve and ideas. Whether this will lead to a harmonious administration or further strife remains an open question as Trump navigates these critical last weeks before inauguration. The outcome of these internal battles will shape not just his Cabinet but the trajectory of his policy agenda for his second term.",

To quote Gomer Pyle, 'Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!'\nJust what did they expect? Trump has never done anything for anyone except himself. If your interests align with his, great, otherwise, forget it.\nRubio has called Hamas 'vicious animals.' Huckabee has dismissed a two-state solution. Stefanik has called the UN a 'cesspool of antisemitism.' Anyone contemplating voting for Trump should have expected what they got. These are Trump's people. Their primary\u2014if not sole\u2014qualification is that they're willing to bend the knee to Trump. Why would anyone expect him to choose anyone else? He doesn't have policies or principles except 'How does it benefit me?'\nIsrael and Netanyahu represent power, Palestine doesn't. Trump\u2014and by extension a Trump administration\u2014will never side with the weak or oppressed. He'll expect the Palestinians to give away the store and surrender. If they don't, he'll watch from some comfortable spot while Israel finishes the job. What he won't do\u2014in any form\u2014is restrict aid to Israel unless he somehow decides it's in his own interests.\nI suspect this is only the beginning of a series of Trump disappointments. The only person or thing he cares about is Donald J. Trump. Folks who expected anything else should've seen this coming. Anyone who voted for Trump expecting him to make things\u2014to make anything\u2014better is in for a rude awakening. Harris was perhaps a flawed candidate but she's still light-years better than Trump or anyone close to him. Karma is on its way and it won't be pretty.\n(See: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/muslims-who-voted-trump-upset-by-his-pro-israel-cabinet-picks-2024-11-15/)",

This is ahead of Trump's return to the White House for his second term. Donald Trump Jr's comments come after President Joe Biden's decision to authorise the Ukrainian military to use American-supplied long-range missiles to target Russia. advertisementBiden's term ends on January 20, the same day President-elect Donald Trump's swearing-in ceremony is scheduled.This move by the Biden administration has raised concerns about escalating tensions between the US and Russia. However, Trump claims he could end the conflict.Trump Jr. claimed in a tweet that the \"military-industrial complex\" is trying to create chaos in the ongoing war.\"The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives. Gotta lock in those $Trillions. Life be damned!!!

Ukraine, after months of requesting the missiles, signalled it would soon deploy them to address battlefield setbacks, according to the New York Post.February 2025 will mark three-years of the Russia-Ukraine war.

'As President Trump has said on the campaign trail, he is the only person who can bring both sides together in order to negotiate peace and work towards ending the war and stopping the killing,' Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung, told the New York Post. However, Trump has not yet disclosed the specifics of his plan to end the war.Donald Trump Jr, the eldest son of President-elect Donald Trump and his first wife, Ivana Trump, has been actively involved in his father's political campaign and activity and is reportedly playing a significant role in the transition team, including helping decide Trump's Cabinet nominees, reported the Post.

        "summary": "Tensions within President-elect Donald Trump's transition team have escalated following a heated altercation at Mar-a-Lago. Elon Musk clashed with Boris Epshteyn, a senior adviser influential in Trump's cabinet selections. The incident has been termed as a 'massive blowup,' by sources, cited in an Axios report. This shows the growing friction between Musk and Trump's long-time aides, who feel overshadowed by Musk's increasing involvement in shaping the administration.\nRelated Articles\nThe confrontation reportedly took place during a dinner at Trump's Florida estate, as per the report by Axios. Musk criticised Epshteyn for backing controversial candidates, notably suggesting Representative Matt Gaetz for attorney general. Musk questioned the qualifications of Epshteyn's recommendations and accused him of leaking information about Trump's personnel decisions to the media. Epshteyn countered, challenging Musk's understanding of the situation.\nThe argument was so intense that it disrupted the otherwise carefully planned transition process. Sources close to Trump's team described it as a 'huge explosion' that had been building up over weeks.\nFor Trump's senior staff, the dinner altercation was not unexpected. Epshteyn has played a pivotal role in coordinating Trump's transition efforts, especially in managing legal defences for Trump's ongoing criminal cases. However, Musk, co-leader of the unofficial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and a vocal supporter of Trump's campaign, has been increasingly asserting his influence. He reportedly advocated for Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, as treasury secretary, clashing with Epshteyn's choices.\nMusk's growing influence in Trump's circle has not gone unnoticed. Often referred to as Trump's 'First Buddy' or 'Uncle Elon' by Trump's granddaughter Kai, Musk has integrated himself with Trump's family and key allies. His role extends beyond his position as co-chief of DOGE, where he collaborates with Vivek Ramaswamy on government efficiency reforms. Musk's influence also spans social and personal dimensions, with Trump allies such as JD Vance, Tucker Carlson, and Trump's sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, welcoming his presence.\nHowever, Musk's involvement in nearly every aspect of Trump's transition\u2014from cabinet picks to high-level meetings\u2014has alienated some long-time members of Trump's team. Reports suggest Musk's frequent presence at Mar-a-Lago has caused friction among Trump loyalists, some of whom believe he is overstepping his bounds.\nInsiders suggest Trump's leadership style may have contributed to the blowup. Known for encouraging competition among his advisers, Trump has seemingly fostered rivalry between Musk and Epshteyn, both of whom wield significant influence in his circle. This tension highlights the challenges of balancing Musk's outsider perspective with the experience of Trump's established aides.",

        "excerpt": "Exclusive: 43 percent of Republicans were surprised by the election result \u2013 while most Americans think their neighbor voted for Trump",
        "summary": "Over half of Americans were surprised by Donald Trump 's win in the presidential election \u2014 including 43 percent of Republicans, according to exclusive data.\npoll of 1,941 US adults by Prolific, exclusively for The Independent, found that, following months of predictions on a knife's edge, Americans on all sides ended up being surprised by the final outcome of the White House race.\nSome 54 percent of people were at least quite surprised by the outcome of the election, with 14 percent of those 'very surprised.' A third were not very surprised, and 16 percent not surprised at all.\nAndrew Gordon, researcher at Prolific, explained that this surprise correlates to difficulties with polling in a polarized environment.\n'The fact that over half of voters, including 43 percent of Republicans, were surprised by the election outcome likely reflects the growing gap between perception and reality in our media-driven environment,' he said.\n'The level of surprise underscores the limitations of polling and media narratives in accurately capturing the public sentiment, especially when polarization is high.'\nAmong Republicans, whose party saw success in the presidential race, as well as in the House and Senate races, 43 percent said they were surprised by the outcome while 8 percent were 'very surprised.'\nOn the other hand, 35 percent of Republicans were not very surprised that Trump won, and 23 percent were not at all surprised.\nThe poll also found that the vast majority of Americans (78 percent) believe that Trump is more powerful now than in his first term.\nThis belief transcends party lines; for some, this may be more positive than others, said Gordon.\n'The widespread agreement that Trump is more powerful now than in 2016 highlights his transformation to a central figure in American political identity. For the US, Trump's growing influence may highlight the ever-extending risk polarization and the rise of personality-driven politics,' he told The Independent.\nWhen Trump won in 2016, he took the electoral college but fell short in the popular vote. The Supreme Court was also relatively evenly split between more liberal and conservative judges at the time.\nThis year's election gave Trump and Republicans a win in the electoral college, popular vote, House, and Senate. In addition, five out of eight justices on the Supreme Court are considered more conservative; meaning that a Republican agenda may face less friction in the courts.\n'For the Republican Party, Trump's dominance has left no question over its current and future direction, but it may have come at the cost of alienating moderates and traditional conservatives,' said Gordon.\n'The focus on Trump-centric politics within the party risks narrowing the party's appeal and in the long term, the party must decide whether to double down on Trump's particular brand of politics or embrace a broader, more classical, Republican approach.'\nDo you know your neighbor?\nIn terms of the popular vote, both Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris had a relatively even split.\nJust 2.7 million more people voted for Trump than Harris, at 50 percent and 48.3 percent respectively.\nDespite this fractional difference, the survey found that a majority (55 percent) of Americans now believe their neighbor voted for Trump; just a third think their neighbor voted for Harris.\nThere appears to be a dissonance between the two parties, too.\nDemocrats are only slightly more likely to think that their neighbor voted for Harris (45 percent) than Trump (41 percent).\nMeanwhile, an overwhelming majority (74 percent) of Republicans believe that their neighbor also supported Trump, compared to just 17 percent Harris.\nUltimately, with such a tight race, the likelihood is that every second person voted for Trump or Harris. So why is it that Trump seems the more obvious choice?\nThere could be several reasons for this.\nOne possible explanation is that Trump dominated in most rural areas, with large stretches of the electoral map being red.\nIt may therefore be more likely for Republicans living in those areas to safely assume their neighbors voted Trump rather than Harris.\nYet while there may be some Harris voters in their midst, silent voting within communities is no new phenomenon, and even at times extends to secret votes within families.\n'For Republicans, this could signal a sense of solidarity within communities where Trump's messaging resonates. Alternatively, it could indicate an overestimation of Trump's support due to the boldness and visibility of his base,' suggested Gordon.\n'It may also hint at a certain level of social desirability bias, where people feel more comfortable attributing conservative leanings to others than admitting them themselves.'\nBy the same token , it may be harder to see why so many Democrats think their neighbor voted Trump. But that can also be partially explained by geography.\nTypically, Democrats perform better in many cities across the US.\nThis year, however, Trump made significant gains in several cities, not least flipping Miami-Dade County for the first time in nearly four decades.\nEven in the blue cities of New York and Chicago, Trump made astonishing inroads in what were considered safe Democrat areas.\nThis transition could also mean that Democrats residing in cities are more uncertain of how their neighbors voted.",

Epshteyn would later work as communications director for Trump's inaugural committee before later joining the 2020 campaign as an adviser for coalitions.\nHe has remained by Trump's side now for many years and is considered a leading figure in the President-elect's inner circle.\nIn April, when Trump arrived in New York for his historic arraignment over falsifying business records charges, Epshteyn sat beside the former president in the courtroom as he pleaded not guilty to 34 charges.\nWhy Is Epshteyn Clashing With Elon Musk?\nThe fighting started over who Trump should pick for his Cabinet, Axios reported.\nSources told the site that Musk was questioning whether Epshteyn had too much influence on Trump's selections. However, Musk was also pushing for his own favorites, recently active in Trump's choice for Treasury Secretary.\nMusk has been an ever-growing presence, with Trump's granddaughter Kai even saying he had been promoted to \"uncle status\" during a family photo after the President-elect's win.\nMusk has reportedly joined the president-elect in a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The CEO of SpaceX and Tesla also spent Election Day at Trump's Mar-a-Lago home and is reported to have a near-constant presence at the resort since the Republican's win.\nTrump has also tapped Musk, along with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, to run the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in order to \"dismantle\" federal bureaucracy and reduce staffing.\nAt one point during the dinner, a \"massive blowup\" and a \"huge explosion\" took place after Musk allegedly accused Epshteyn of leaking details about Trump's transition plans. Epshteyn allegedly said he didn't know what Musk was talking about.\nAccording to Axios, the tension between the two has been brewing since before the November 5 election.\nBoris Epshteyn's Net Worth and Career History\nEpshteyn is an attorney and investment banker with a stake worth between $1 million and $5 million in TGP Securities Inc, as reported by Fortune.\nAfter graduating from law school, Epshteyn worked as a part of the Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy finance practice, specifically with bank finance, security transactions and private placement.\nIn 2008, Epshteyn served as the communications aide with former Senator John McCain and former Governor Sarah Palin campaign.\nIn 2016, he acted as a senior adviser to Trump's campaign.\nDonald Trump gestures, followed by his adviser Boris Epshteyn, during his trial at Manhattan criminal court on Thursday, May 16, 2024, in New York.

His segment ended in 2019.\nFor Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, Epshteyn served as the strategic adviser and co-chair of the Jewish Voices for Trump Advisory Board.\nEpshteyn's Ties to January 6\nEpshteyn is believed to be the sixth co-conspirator included in the latest criminal indictment against the former president.\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith has charged Trump with four offenses in relation to the 2020 election and January 6 federal probe\u2014conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy against rights of citizens; obstructing an official proceeding; and conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding.\nFive of the co-conspirators were identifiable due to clues in the indictment, including publicly available information, quotes and dates of meetings.\nThe sixth alleged co-conspirator is now believed to be Epshteyn, who is said to have been a key figure in the plot to install fake electors in several key states to falsely declare Trump had beaten Joe Biden in 2020.\nA December 2020 email sent from Epshteyn to Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani matches a description of one detailed in Trump's indictment. The email sent from Epshteyn to Giuliani and Giuliani's son, Andrew, contained the subject line, \"Attorneys for Electors Memo,\" reported The New York Times.\nIn 2022, Epshteyn, along with Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Trump's assistant Jenna Ellis, was subpoenaed to give evidence to the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 attack.\nEpshteyn was also subpoenaed as part of the federal investigation into the events leading up to the January 6 attack, and had his phone seized by the FBI as part of the inquiry.\nHe was indicted in April 2024 for his alleged role in the fake election allegations in Arizona.",

        "summary": "While Inauguration Day is still about two months away, Donald Trump has made swift announcements about some of his selections for members of his Cabinet and second administration.\nTwo weeks into his first presidential transition, Trump had only named three key people to his administration: the chief of staff, the attorney general and the ambassador to the United Nations, according to a timeline by Politico. Within the same time frame since this Election Day, he has named more than 10 Cabinet positions and a slate of other key positions within his administration.\nBut he won't be able to officially get to work for a couple of months. Here is what to know.\nWhen is Inauguration Day?\nTrump's inauguration is scheduled for Jan. 20, 2025 in Washington, D.C.\nPresidential transition news\nTrump has made rapid-fire announcements on who he wants in his administration.\nHere are some of the key positions he has named so far:\nChief of Staff: Trump named his senior campaign adviser Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, the first woman in history to hold the title. The Florida political consultant largely stays out of the spotlight, but has been credited with helping Trump's political comeback.\nAttorney General: Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has been nominated as the next attorney general overseeing the Justice Department, that he has long criticized.\nSecretary of State: Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is nominated as the next secretary of state. He will bring foreign policy experience through his roles in the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A Cuban-American, he is set to be the first Latino person to be secretary of state.\nDirector of National Intelligence: Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is nominated as the director of national intelligence. The former Democratic presidential candidate-turned Republican represented Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District from 2013-2021.\nDeputy chief of staff for policy: Long-standing Trump adviser Stephen Miller has been tapped for deputy chief of staff for policy in Trump's next administration. The 39-year-old served as senior adviser to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House and is credited with shaping Trump's immigration policies.\nAmbassador to the United Nations: Trump nominated Elise Stefanik, a five-term Republican representing a northern New York district, as his pick for UN ambassador. She is the House Republican Conference Chair and a former contender for Trump's running mate.\n'Border czar': Trump has appointed Tom Homan to oversee deportation policy and aviation security. Homan was a Border Patrol agent for 34 years and served in Trump's first administration as acting ICE director. He drew controversy for strict immigration enforcement, including the \"zero-tolerance\" policy which separated families of undocumented immigrants.\nEPA head: Trump has appointed Lee Zeldin as the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protective Agency. Zeldin was a Congressman for parts of Long Island, New York and ran but lost against Kathy Hochul in the 2022 gubernatorial race.\nNational security adviser: Trump has named Florida Rep. Mike Waltz as his national security adviser. Waltz has held civilian positions at the Pentagon, was on the House Armed Services Committee and has supported Trump's isolationist view of foreign relations.\nU.S. ambassador to Israel: Trump announced he is nominating former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as his U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is a Baptist minister and former Fox News host, who has run for the Republican presidential nomination twice, unsuccessfully. His daughter is Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as White House press secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency: Trump designated his former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe as CIA director. Ratcliffe previously was a House member from Texas before serving as director of national intelligence at the end of Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Defense: Trump nominated Fox News host Pete Hegseth to Defense secretary. A Fox News commentator, Hegseth served in the U.S. Army National Guard and had led veteran's advocacy groups.\nSecretary of Homeland Security: Trump announced his choice of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to be the secretary of Homeland Security. The pick puts the hardline conservative governor, who sent the state's National Guard to the southern border, in a key role on immigration.\nWhite House counsel: Trump tapped William McGinley to serve as his White House counsel. McGinley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm Holtzman Vogel, worked as White House Cabinet secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs: Trump named Doug Collins to be his secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins, a former congressman from 2013 to 2021 and trusted Trump loyalist, is a chaplain of the United States Air Force Reserve Command.\nSecretary of Interior: Trump named North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as his nominee for secretary of Interior. Burgum, a 68-year-old wealthy software executive, ran against Trump in the 2020 election but dropped out in December. As secretary for the Interior, he would oversee federal land and run programs involving native tribes.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services: Trump announced Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his pick to oversee the department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy ran as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump. He is known for his vaccine hesitancy and stance against fluoride in water, despite both being widely encouraged by medical professionals.\nDepartment of Government Efficiency: Trump named Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a newly created initiative to slash government spending. Trump's stated plan is for the department to advise from outside the government.\nTrump also visited Washington D.C. Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House and address congressional Republicans. Biden and Trump met for nearly two hours in a traditional meeting between the incoming and outgoing presidents that signifies the peaceful transition of power. Trump did not invite Biden to the White House in 2020.",

Trump won a decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris on Nov. 5, sweeping the nation's battleground states and also clinching the first popular vote win for a Republican in 20 years.\nDid Taylor Swift's Endorsement Of Kamala Harris Move The Needle In The 2024 Election?\nBrzezinski took a moment to respond to the viewers who may have been appalled that they would agree to speak with Trump, whom they've repeatedly described as a threat to democracy.\nRead On The Fox News App\n\"For those asking why we would go speak to the president-elect during such fraught times, especially between us, I guess I would ask back \u2013 why wouldn't we?\" she said. \"Five years of political warfare has deeply divided Washington and the country. We have been as clear as we know how in expressing our deep concerns about President Trump's actions and words in the coarsening of public debate.\n\"But for nearly 80 million Americans, election denialism, public trials, January 6, were not as important as the issues that moved them to send Donald Trump back to the White House with their vote. Joe and I realize it's time to do something different, and that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump, but also talking with him.\"\nThe defensive tone about speaking to Trump was noteworthy given \"Morning Joe\" was upset by NBC's hiring of Trump ally Ronna McDaniel earlier this year as a paid analyst. The show and several other MSNBC luminaries publicly spoke out against McDaniel appearing on their airwaves, and her contract was terminated after less than a week.\nCnn, Msnbc Could Return To Resistance Tv After Being Reliable Anti-trump Networks During First Term\nBrzezinski said Trump's term would be a \"consequential\" presidency, but time would tell if it was \"constructive.\" She railed against threatening political opponents and also noted that impeachments and trials tend to turn politicians into martyrs.\n\"Just ask Bill Clinton and Donald Trump,\" she said.\nScarborough noted that Trump can't seek another term so this could be an opportunity for \"both parties to get to work,\" and claimed top Democrats had confided to him they were open to working with Trump if the feeling was mutual.\n\"Don't be mistaken,\" Scarborough said. \"We're not here to defend or normalize Donald Trump. We're here to report on him and to hopefully provide you insights that are going to better equip all of us in understanding these deeply unsettling times.\"\nThat might not sit well with some of their fellow MSNBC hosts or liberal media colleagues.\n\"Morning Joe\" co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough stood out in their bullishness on Trump's political chances in 2015 and 2016 and frequently interviewed him on their show, but they became two of his most vehement critics after he became president.\nJen Psaki Says Democrats Are Lost In The 'Wilderness' Without A Clear Leader After Trump's Victory\nBrzezinski also revealed Monday that Scarborough called Trump the day after the assassination attempt against him in July, but other than that, they had not even spoken since 2020. MSNBC kept \"Morning Joe\" off the air the Monday after the shooting in a controversial move at the time.\nScarborough and Brzezinski, who are married, stood out in the 2016 cycle for their bullishness on Trump's political chances early in the Republican primary, and they took heat for frequently hosting and interviewing the future president. But they became two of his staunchest critics once he took office and Trump at times leveled intensely personal attacks on the pair.\nScarborough, a former Florida U.S. congressman, left the Republican Party in 2017 over his disagreements with Trump.\nOriginal article source: 'Morning Joe' co-hosts hold face-to-face meeting with Trump for first time in seven years",

        "excerpt": "Donald Trump hit the ground running with his transition to the White House ahead of Inauguration Day 2025.",
        "summary": "While Inauguration Day is still about two months away, Donald Trump has made swift announcements about some of his selections for members of his Cabinet and second administration.\nTwo weeks into his first presidential transition, Trump had only named three key people to his administration: the chief of staff, the attorney general and the ambassador to the United Nations, according to a timeline by Politico. Within the same time frame since this Election Day, he has named more than 10 Cabinet positions and a slate of other key positions within his administration.\nBut he won't be able to officially get to work for a couple of months. Here is what to know.\nWhen is Inauguration Day?\nTrump's inauguration is scheduled for Jan. 20, 2025 in Washington, D.C.\nPresidential transition news\nTrump has made rapid-fire announcements on who he wants in his administration.\nHere are some of the key positions he has named so far:\nChief of Staff: Trump named his senior campaign adviser Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, the first woman in history to hold the title. The Florida political consultant largely stays out of the spotlight, but has been credited with helping Trump's political comeback.\nAttorney General: Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has been nominated as the next attorney general overseeing the Justice Department, that he has long criticized.\nSecretary of State: Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is nominated as the next secretary of state. He will bring foreign policy experience through his roles in the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A Cuban-American, he is set to be the first Latino person to be secretary of state.\nDirector of National Intelligence: Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is nominated as the director of national intelligence. The former Democratic presidential candidate-turned Republican represented Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District from 2013-2021.\nDeputy chief of staff for policy: Long-standing Trump adviser Stephen Miller has been tapped for deputy chief of staff for policy in Trump's next administration. The 39-year-old served as senior adviser to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House and is credited with shaping Trump's immigration policies.\nAmbassador to the United Nations: Trump nominated Elise Stefanik, a five-term Republican representing a northern New York district, as his pick for UN ambassador. She is the House Republican Conference Chair and a former contender for Trump's running mate.\n'Border czar': Trump has appointed Tom Homan to oversee deportation policy and aviation security. Homan was a Border Patrol agent for 34 years and served in Trump's first administration as acting ICE director. He drew controversy for strict immigration enforcement, including the \"zero-tolerance\" policy which separated families of undocumented immigrants.\nEPA head: Trump has appointed Lee Zeldin as the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protective Agency. Zeldin was a Congressman for parts of Long Island, New York and ran but lost against Kathy Hochul in the 2022 gubernatorial race.\nNational security adviser: Trump has named Florida Rep. Mike Waltz as his national security adviser. Waltz has held civilian positions at the Pentagon, was on the House Armed Services Committee and has supported Trump's isolationist view of foreign relations.\nU.S. ambassador to Israel: Trump announced he is nominating former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as his U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is a Baptist minister and former Fox News host, who has run for the Republican presidential nomination twice, unsuccessfully. His daughter is Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as White House press secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency: Trump designated his former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe as CIA director. Ratcliffe previously was a House member from Texas before serving as director of national intelligence at the end of Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Defense: Trump nominated Fox News host Pete Hegseth to Defense secretary. A Fox News commentator, Hegseth served in the U.S. Army National Guard and had led veteran's advocacy groups.\nSecretary of Homeland Security: Trump announced his choice of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to be the secretary of Homeland Security. The pick puts the hardline conservative governor, who sent the state's National Guard to the southern border, in a key role on immigration.\nWhite House counsel: Trump tapped William McGinley to serve as his White House counsel. McGinley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm Holtzman Vogel, worked as White House Cabinet secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs: Trump named Doug Collins to be his secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins, a former congressman from 2013 to 2021 and trusted Trump loyalist, is a chaplain of the United States Air Force Reserve Command.\nSecretary of Interior: Trump named North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as his nominee for secretary of Interior. Burgum, a 68-year-old wealthy software executive, ran against Trump in the 2020 election but dropped out in December. As secretary for the Interior, he would oversee federal land and run programs involving native tribes.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services: Trump announced Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his pick to oversee the department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy ran as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump. He is known for his vaccine hesitancy and stance against fluoride in water, despite both being widely encouraged by medical professionals.\nDepartment of Government Efficiency: Trump named Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a newly created initiative to slash government spending. Trump's stated plan is for the department to advise from outside the government.\nTrump also visited Washington D.C. Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House and address congressional Republicans. Biden and Trump met for nearly two hours in a traditional meeting between the incoming and outgoing presidents that signifies the peaceful transition of power. Trump did not invite Biden to the White House in 2020.\nContributing: Greta Cross, Joey Garrison, Francesca Chambers",

        "summary": "Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski are restarting communications with President-elect Donald Trump.\nThe hosts of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" revealed Monday that they met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Friday, which Brzezinski noted was the \"first time we have seen him in seven years.\" She said they had also not spoken to Trump at all since March 2020, other than a phone call Scarborough made to the former president after he survived an assassination attempt in July.\n\"In this meeting, President Trump was cheerful, he was upbeat, he seemed interested in finding common ground with Democrats on some of the most divisive issues,\" Brzezinski said. \"And for those asking why we would go speak to the president-elect during such fraught times, especially between us, I guess I would ask back, 'Why wouldn't we?'\"\nStart the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.\nAccording to Scarborough, topics in the meeting included \"abortion, mass deportations,\" and \"threats of political retribution against political opponents and media outlets,\" and he said it should come as no surprise that they \"didn't see eye to eye on a lot of issues.\"\nMorning Joe' hosts Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski are married; get the details\nBut both parties agreed they would \"restart communications,\" Brzezinski said, comparing the meeting to the way a president's national security advisor will talk with world leaders with whom the United States has profound disagreements.\nThe \"Morning Joe\" hosts have been outspoken critics of Trump on their show but at one time had a better relationship with the president-elect, communicating with him frequently on and off the air. In December 2016, Scarborough told Politico that they \"talk to Trump a few times a week.\"\nJoe Scarborough criticizes MSNBC for taking 'Morning Joe' off-air Monday: 'Very disappointed'\nBut their relationship took a turn after Trump assumed office as the MSNBC hosts increasingly took issue with his actions as president and as Trump attacked the \"crazy\" and \"psycho\" hosts on social media. In a controversial 2017 tweet, Trump wrote that Brzezinski \"was bleeding badly from a face-lift\" when she came to Mar-a-Lago the previous year.\nJimmy Kimmel, more late-night hosts 'shocked' by Trump Cabinet picks: 'Goblins and weirdos'\nBrzezinski told viewers on Monday that although she and Scarborough have \"deep concerns about President Trump's actions and words,\" nearly 80 million Americans voted for him, so it's \"time to do something different, and that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump, but also talking with him.\" She added that they told Trump they will continue to \"push back hard\" on him when appropriate.\n\"Don't be mistaken: We're not here to defend or normalize Donald Trump,\" Scarborough said. \"We're here to report on him, and to hopefully provide you insights that are going to better equip all of us in understanding these deeply unsettling times.\"\nScarborough previously said that Americans who vote for Trump this year would be \"knowingly voting for a fascist\" and \"a racist.\" He also said on \"Morning Joe\" that Trump is a threat to democracy and the 2024 election would determine whether \"Madisonian democracy survives.\"\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski reveal they met with Trump: 'Why wouldn't we?'",

        "excerpt": "Donald Trump nominated Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy and personal lawyer Will Scharf as a White House staff secretary.",
        "summary": "Republicans were on the defensive about two of President-elect Donald Trump's most controversial Cabinet picks Sunday.\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) said on CNN's State of the Union that a House Ethics Committee investigation into Trump's pick for attorney general and staunch Trump-loyalist Matt Gaetz should not be revealed. The Justice Department investigated sex trafficking allegations against Gaetz. The investigation ended without charges, but the House Ethics Committee continued to look into the allegation he assaulted a 17-year-old.\nAn attorney for Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice for Secretary of Defense, told multiple outlets that Hegseth paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017 because he feared losing his job at Fox News. Hegseth has denied the sexual assault allegation and was never charged, however he paid the woman as part of a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality provision after she threatened litigation in 2020, the attorney told media outlets.\nThough Trump did not add to his administration Sunday, the president-elect did name his choices for secretary of Energy and a prominent White House aide Saturday.\nTrump appointed personal lawyer Will Scharf, who played a key role in defending Trump in the federal criminal case tied to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, to be an assistant to the president and White House staff secretary. Scharf is the fourth personal attorney of Trump's to be named to the incoming administration.\nChris Wright to be nominated as Secretary of Energy\nLiberty Oilfield Services Inc. CEO Chris Wright (C) talks with NYSE Group President Thomas Farley while waiting for the company's IPO on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., January 12, 2018.\nTrump said Saturday he plans to nominate oil industry executive Chris Wright, CEO of Liberty Energy and 2024 campaign donor to lead the Department of Energy in his second term in the White House.\nThe department oversees the country's energy supplies, research and development of nuclear power, 17 national laboratories and the cleanup of Cold War-era nuclear efforts.\nWright will also be a member of Trump's newly-formed Council of National Energy, which is set to be led by Interior Secretary nominee Doug Burgum, the president-elect said in his statement.\nIn a video posted in 2023 on LinkedIn, Wright denied the scientific consensus that manmade greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for the warming planet.\n\"There is no climate crisis and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,\" said Wright, whose company counts among its services the hydraulic fracking technique used to extract natural gas and oil from deep below the Earth's surface.\nTrump's announcement is an indication that he intends to nominate Wright for Senate approval, however Trump has floated the demand that Republican Senate leadership allow for recess appointments as an end-around of the confirmation process.\nWhat are recess appointments? Here's what to know as Trump looks to fill his Cabinet\nTrump's picks so far: What we know\nHere are Trump's picks for key positions in his administration, as of Sunday night.\nChief of Staff: Trump named his senior campaign adviser Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, the first woman in history to hold the title.

She is the House Republican Conference Chair and a former contender for Trump's running mate.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services: Trump has named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The 2024 independent candidate has previously criticized vaccines and questioned the origin of the COVID-19 virus. He is arguably best known for spreading unfounded claims about a link between childhood vaccines and autism.\nSecretary of Defense: Trump nominated Fox News host Pete Hegseth to Defense secretary. A Fox News commentator, Hegseth served in the U.S. Army National Guard and had led veteran's advocacy groups.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator: Trump has appointed Lee Zeldin as the administrator of The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Doug Collins to be his secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. He served as a congressman representing Georgia's 9th district from 2013 to 2021. A trusted Trump loyalist, he is a chaplain of the United States Air Force Reserve Command and served in the Iraq War in 2008.\nSecretary of the Department of Energy: Trump is nominating oil industry executive Chris Wright , CEO of Liberty Energy and 2024 campaign donor to lead the Department of Energy. Wright, who has expressed skepticism about climate change science, would join a Trump administration that campaigned to roll back climate change policies and clean energy spending ushered in during President Biden's term.\nDeputy chief of staff for policy : Long-standing Trump adviser Stephen Miller has been tapped for deputy chief of staff for policy in Trump's next administration. The 39-year-old served as senior adviser to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House and is credited with shaping Trump's immigration policies.\n'Border czar' : Trump has appointed Tom Homan to oversee deportation policy and aviation security.

Blanche is known for aggressively representing the president-elect in his New York hush money trial and in two federal criminal cases.\nWhite House Communications Director: Trump named Steven Cheung to be his communications director in his second term. Cheung worked as the rapid response director for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and was perhaps the most adversarial of the candidate's spokespersons, describing opponents and \"snowflakes\" and \"cucks\" who suffered from \"Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary: Trump named Karoline Leavitt as his second-term White House press secretary. She's expected to be the youngest to ever hold the position.\nWhat are the Cabinet positions?\nThe Cabinet advises the president on issues related to their respective offices.\nThese are the Cabinet positions from the 15 executive departments, which must be confirmed by the Senate:\nSecretary of State\nSecretary of Defense\nAttorney General\nSecretary of the Interior\nSecretary of Agriculture\nSecretary of Commerce\nSecretary of Labor\nSecretary of Health and Human Services\nSecretary of Transportation\nSecretary of Energy\nSecretary of Education\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs\nSecretary of Homeland Security\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\nSecretary of Treasury\nThe Cabinet and presidential advisers can also include the vice president, the chief of staff, the ambassador to the United Nations, the director of National Intelligence, the U.S. trade representative, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, the head of the Council of Economic Advisors, the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the head of the Small Business Administration.\nContributing: Zac Anderson, Darren Samuelsohn, Karen Weintraub, Alyssa Goldberg, Tom Vanden Brook, David Jackson, Savannah Kuchar, Victor Hagan, Bart Jansen, Fernando Cervantes Jr., Riley Beggin, Michael Collins, Joey Garrison; Kaycee Sloan, Cincinnati Enquirer.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Who are Trump's Cabinet picks so far?

These were allegations he had broken the law attempting to overturn the 2024 presidential election and that he mishandled classified documents, both of which the former president denied.\nIn July, Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the classified documents case, which she had been overseeing, on the basis that Smith's appointment was unconstitutional. Last week, The New York Times reported Smith plans to resign as special counsel before Trump begins his second presidency in January.\nSpeaking in June 2023, Trump said that if returned to the White House, he would \"appoint a real special prosecutor to go after\" President Biden along with \"all others involved with the destruction of our elections, borders, & country itself!\"\nDuring a WABC radio interview in October, Trump also suggested that Smith should be exiled.\nHe said: \"You have to get the killers, the murders, and mentally deranged, you have to get them out.

More\nAllison Robbert-Pool/GETTY\nOn his podcast, Bharara suggested Cannon's dismissal of Trump's classified documents case on the basis Smith was unconstitutionally appointed as special counsel could make it harder for the incoming president to appoint a special counsel of his own to target political rivals.\nHowever, Bharara went on to argue this wouldn't matter as Trump wouldn't want someone with \"punitive independence\" from the Department of Justice to lead any investigations.\nReferring to the possibility of Trump targeting \"political adversaries\" he said: \"I think at the end of the day, if he pursues such things, he's not going to want that to be done by someone who has punitive independence and separation from the department. If he's going to weaponize the department, he's going to weaponize the department.\"\nNewsweek contacted representatives for Donald Trump by email on Monday.\nIn May 2024, Trump became the first former president with a felony record in American history after he was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business documents to cover up the payment of hush money to a former adult film actress ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nSentencing is due on November 26 though speaking to Newsweek Professor David Driesen, a constitutional law professor at Syracuse University, said Trump is highly unlikely to serve a prison sentence while president.\nHe said: \"The Supreme Court may invent new law to keep Trump out of jail if New York Justice Juan Merchan sentences him to prison while his time in office.\n\"The high court has already shown a willingness to protect Trump, especially when it granted him immunity from criminal trial for official misconduct in Trump v. United States.\"",

        "excerpt": "Donald Trump hit the ground running with his transition to the White House ahead of Inauguration Day 2025.",
        "summary": "While Inauguration Day is still about two months away, Donald Trump has made swift announcements about some of his selections for members of his Cabinet and second administration.\nTwo weeks into his first presidential transition, Trump had only named three key people to his administration: the chief of staff, the attorney general and the ambassador to the United Nations, according to a timeline by Politico. Within the same time frame since this Election Day, he has named more than 10 Cabinet positions and a slate of other key positions within his administration.\nBut he won't be able to officially get to work for a couple of months. Here is what to know.\nWhen is Inauguration Day?\nTrump's inauguration is scheduled for Jan. 20, 2025 in Washington, D.C.\nPresidential transition news\nTrump has made rapid-fire announcements on who he wants in his administration.\nHere are some of the key positions he has named so far:\nChief of Staff: Trump named his senior campaign adviser Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, the first woman in history to hold the title. The Florida political consultant largely stays out of the spotlight, but has been credited with helping Trump's political comeback.\nAttorney General: Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has been nominated as the next attorney general overseeing the Justice Department, that he has long criticized.\nSecretary of State: Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is nominated as the next secretary of state. He will bring foreign policy experience through his roles in the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A Cuban-American, he is set to be the first Latino person to be secretary of state.\nDirector of National Intelligence: Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is nominated as the director of national intelligence. The former Democratic presidential candidate-turned Republican represented Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District from 2013-2021.\nDeputy chief of staff for policy: Long-standing Trump adviser Stephen Miller has been tapped for deputy chief of staff for policy in Trump's next administration. The 39-year-old served as senior adviser to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House and is credited with shaping Trump's immigration policies.\nAmbassador to the United Nations: Trump nominated Elise Stefanik, a five-term Republican representing a northern New York district, as his pick for UN ambassador. She is the House Republican Conference Chair and a former contender for Trump's running mate.\n'Border czar': Trump has appointed Tom Homan to oversee deportation policy and aviation security. Homan was a Border Patrol agent for 34 years and served in Trump's first administration as acting ICE director. He drew controversy for strict immigration enforcement, including the \"zero-tolerance\" policy which separated families of undocumented immigrants.\nEPA head: Trump has appointed Lee Zeldin as the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protective Agency. Zeldin was a Congressman for parts of Long Island, New York and ran but lost against Kathy Hochul in the 2022 gubernatorial race.\nNational security adviser: Trump has named Florida Rep. Mike Waltz as his national security adviser. Waltz has held civilian positions at the Pentagon, was on the House Armed Services Committee and has supported Trump's isolationist view of foreign relations.\nU.S. ambassador to Israel: Trump announced he is nominating former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as his U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is a Baptist minister and former Fox News host, who has run for the Republican presidential nomination twice, unsuccessfully. His daughter is Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as White House press secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency: Trump designated his former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe as CIA director. Ratcliffe previously was a House member from Texas before serving as director of national intelligence at the end of Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Defense: Trump nominated Fox News host Pete Hegseth to Defense secretary. A Fox News commentator, Hegseth served in the U.S. Army National Guard and had led veteran's advocacy groups.\nSecretary of Homeland Security: Trump announced his choice of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to be the secretary of Homeland Security. The pick puts the hardline conservative governor, who sent the state's National Guard to the southern border, in a key role on immigration.\nWhite House counsel: Trump tapped William McGinley to serve as his White House counsel. McGinley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm Holtzman Vogel, worked as White House Cabinet secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs: Trump named Doug Collins to be his secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins, a former congressman from 2013 to 2021 and trusted Trump loyalist, is a chaplain of the United States Air Force Reserve Command.\nSecretary of Interior: Trump named North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as his nominee for secretary of Interior. Burgum, a 68-year-old wealthy software executive, ran against Trump in the 2020 election but dropped out in December. As secretary for the Interior, he would oversee federal land and run programs involving native tribes.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services: Trump announced Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his pick to oversee the department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy ran as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump. He is known for his vaccine hesitancy and stance against fluoride in water, despite both being widely encouraged by medical professionals.\nDepartment of Government Efficiency: Trump named Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a newly created initiative to slash government spending. Trump's stated plan is for the department to advise from outside the government.\nTrump also visited Washington D.C. Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House and address congressional Republicans. Biden and Trump met for nearly two hours in a traditional meeting between the incoming and outgoing presidents that signifies the peaceful transition of power. Trump did not invite Biden to the White House in 2020.",

Trump is not the hero who is going to save us from The New World Order because he is part of it.\n1) Catchy 'Super Trump' song sung by the Jerusalem Boy's Choir. The Israelis love Trump, which tells you who he is really working for.\n2:56\n2) This commentator claims that Trump is on the side of the 'Deep State' which he says is Israel.\n20:50\n3) Trump promises to support Israel's genocidal war on the Palestinians.\n1:20\n4) Trump vows to work on 'extract(ing) the hateful poison of antisemitism from our world' and further on in his speech he calls for the death penalty for people in some unspecified group. The video is edited so it is hard to know who he is referring to.\n2:38\n5) Trumps pledges to crush antisemitism.\n43 seconds\n6) Trump is sounding a lot like jewish Bolshevik leaders from a century ago. Weird, huh?\n39 seconds\n7) Trump explains that 'we have to get the people of our country, of this country, to love Israel more.' I am hoping that Americans are loving Israel less and less after losing friends and family members to jew-created wars in the Middle East, watching the Israelis genocide the Palestinians, seeing how much control Israel and jews have over our country and understanding how much destruction they are wreaking on the United States and the world.\n20 seconds\n8) In this 2023 speech, Trump cheers on Israel and says that he will cut off aid to the Palestinians and deport foreigners who support Hamas, which really means those who protest Israel's genocide of the Palestinians.\n4:33\n9) Trump the Zionist.\n1:09:49\n10) The jews behind Trump.\n10:55\n11) Super Trump, the Golden Golem, sporting a yarmulke and doing jewish stuff with jews.\n2:58\nI hope to add more videos to this page, but this is about all I can stomach for now. It is really revolting to watch Trump endlessly praising Israel knowing all that I know now about Israel and jewish supremacism.

        "summary": "MSNBC's Morning Joe co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski\u2014both vocal critics of Donald Trump\u2014confirmed meeting with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend to \"restart communications,\" surprising many.\nAnticipating criticism from Democratic viewers and other liberals upset over Trump's re-election in the November 5 election, Brzezinski defended the decision, asking, \"Why wouldn't\" she and Scarborough\u2014her husband\u2014meet with him?\nShortly after reports of the meeting surfaced online, a Truth Social post allegedly from Trump addressing the encounter began circulating. In the post, widely shared on Elon Musk's X, Trump claimed the MSNBC hosts \"begged to meet\" with him and described Brzezinski as \"charming, as usual.\"\nThe Claim\nA post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) claimed that Trump described Brzezinski as \"charming\" in a Truth Social post following a supposed meeting with her and Joe Scarborough at Mar-a-Lago.\nThe post also claimed that Joe Scarborough had \"begged\" Trump for the meeting and that Scarborough approached Trump \"like a scolded dog.\" The alleged statement, written in a style mimicking Trump's characteristic tone, has been shared more than 1,000 times and has reached over 500,000 views.\nThe Facts\nAs of November 18, 2024, there is no evidence that Donald Trump made this statement on Truth Social or any of his official platforms. A review of Trump's verified Truth Social account found no such post, nor has the claim been reported by any credible media outlets that closely monitor his communications.\nThe image of the alleged post has circulated widely on X, primarily from accounts with blue checkmarks seeking to maximize impressions. The most shared version originates from the account @ING2Firebrand, which, based on a Newsweek review, appears to be run by a Trump supporter.\nMoreover, the formatting in the image shows slight inconsistencies with Truth Social's interface, such as font alignment and spacing issues. These discrepancies strongly suggest the post was fabricated using editing tools designed to mimic Truth Social's design.\nMSNBC's Morning Joe co-hosts, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, both vocal critics of Donald Trump, confirmed meeting with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend to \"restart communications.\"\nMSNBC's Morning Joe co-hosts, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, both vocal critics of Donald Trump, confirmed meeting with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend to \"restart communications.\"\nMSNBC / Getty Images\nAdditionally, there is no evidence to support the claim that Scarborough \"begged\" Trump for a meeting.

There is no verified evidence that Donald Trump made a Truth Social post describing Mika Brzezinski as \"charming,\" claiming Joe Scarborough \"begged\" for a meeting, or alleging that Scarborough acted \"like a scolded dog.\" The viral post is a fabrication, with no credible records, evidence, or official announcements supporting the claims.\nFACT CHECK BY NEWSWEEK",

        "summary": "More signs are beginning to emerge of a fracture in the relationship between Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who dumped money into Trump's successful presidential bid. Even before Trump's inauguration, there are indications he is rebelling at the notion that Musk wields disproportionate influence over his decision-making or, even worse, is truly the one in control.\nThe decision of whom to nominate as treasury secretary will be one of Trump's most important calls since that official will determine fiscal policy and have an enormous impact on the domestic and global economy. In Trump's last go-round, he left office with high unemployment and the worst net job loss of any president since the statistic has been tracked.\nMusk favors the appointment of Howard Lutnick, co-chair of Trump's transition team, for the job. He went public with his position and contrasted it with the possible pick of Scott Bessent, posting, 'My view [for what it's worth] is that Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas [Lutnick] will actually enact change.'\nThe public statement has apparently given Trump second thoughts, and he is now considering other candidates for the position. The Washington Post cites sources in the Trump camp pointing to Musk's statement as a problem.\n'People are not happy,' the source told the paper, explaining that Trump's circle is displeased with the perception that Musk has been operating as a 'co-president.'\nAt the same time as the treasury-secretary problem emerged, Musk is reportedly at odds with Boris Epshteyn, a longtime member of Trump's inner circle.\nCiting multiple sources, Axios reported that there was a 'massive blowup' and 'huge explosion' between the two men after Musk accused Epshteyn of leaking details of the transition's inner workings to the media, including the names of possible Cabinet nominations.\nEpshteyn has been with Trump for a long time, even spending years providing pro-Trump video editorials that were distributed across the nation on the right-wing Sinclair Broadcast Group's network of local TV stations. Trump has repeatedly emphasized the importance of personal loyalty, and Epshteyn appears to have far more in his favor on this measure than Musk, a recent Trump convert.\nMusk also saw his campaign to install Florida Sen. Rick Scott as Senate majority leader fail. He announced his support via tweet before Trump had weighed in on the issue, only to be embarrassed as Senate Republicans chose South Dakota Sen. John Thune to be their new leader.\nMusk spent millions to help elect Trump and is now flexing his muscles as a political influencer. But Trump has infamously made it clear that there is no room for a co-pilot in his position as head of the party and the conservative movement (remember former Vice President Mike Pence?). So while the Musk-Trump relationship is still in its early phases, history is not on the side of this hastily arranged bromance.",

During his first administration, Trump used the National Emergencies Act to justify diverting billions of dollars in military construction funding to build a 30-foot steel fence along some portions of the U.S-Mexico border.\nThe House of Representatives sued the administration, as did environmental groups and immigrant advocates \u2013 cases that were put to bed after Trump left office and the Biden administration ended border fence construction.

        "excerpt": "Ukraine and the rest of Europe anxiously followed the U.S. presidential election results on Nov. 6, which ultimately reported Donald Trump and J.D. Vance as the winners, with the Republican Party also\u2026",
        "summary": "Ukraine and the rest of Europe anxiously followed the U.S. presidential election results on Nov. 6, which ultimately reported Donald Trump and J.D. Vance as the winners, with the Republican Party also securing majorities in the House and Senate. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky quickly called the president-elect to offer congratulations and express interest in strengthening ties.\nBut what does a Trump-Vance administration mean for Europe and Ukraine? Looking at past actions and campaign statements may provide insight.\nDuring his 2016-2020 term, Trump's stance toward NATO and Ukraine often raised eyebrows. He called NATO 'obsolete' and argued that the U.S. should not be the world's police force. Trump withdrew American soldiers from Europe and opposed expanding the U.S. military presence there. He declined to fully endorse NATO's Article 5, which commits members to collective defense, and former aides reported that Trump even considered pulling out of the alliance.\nRead also: Opinion: With Trump back, Europe can't afford to guess on sanctions against Russia\nTrump's views on Ukraine also emerged during the 2016 election when he accused Ukraine of interfering in the U.S. election against him \u2014 a claim later disproven by the FBI. Then, in 2019, he withheld defense assistance to Ukraine and requested that Zelensky investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) later ruled that withholding aid passed by Congress was illegal. The House of Representatives impeached Trump, though the Senate ultimately acquitted him.\nAfter losing the 2020 election, Trump vowed a political comeback and eventually secured the 2024 Republican nomination. During his campaign, Trump's positions on NATO and Ukraine remained unchanged \u2014 and even hardened.\nAt a recent rally, Trump reiterated that NATO members must meet the 2% defense spending threshold, stating he would not protect allies who fail to do so. \"You don't pay your bills, you get no protection,\" he said. Trump suggested he would let Russia \"do whatever the hell they want\" if a country falls short on payments.\nMany former officials from the Trump-Pence administration believe Trump is likely to withdraw from NATO, jeopardizing European security.\nRegarding Ukraine, Trump pledged to end the war in one day by forcing Ukrainian officials to negotiate with Russia and cede territory. He has argued that U.S. aid to Ukraine is excessive and has called for cuts. Now, with the election behind him, Trump is expected to push for a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine that would likely reduce U.S. support. Trump has also said he would seek to delay Ukraine's NATO membership bid.\nVance shares Trump's critical views on NATO and Ukraine. He has argued that European countries should handle their own security issues without U.S. involvement. Vance, who has opposed every bill supporting Ukraine since Russia's invasion, has said he 'doesn't really care' about Ukraine and that the U.S. should stop its aid. He also opposes Ukraine's potential NATO membership, arguing it should remain neutral.\nWith Republicans in control of Congress, Trump and Vance will find support for their isolationist policies. House Speaker Mike Johnson, for example, has called on Europe to take more responsibility for its own security and suggested that NATO allies increase their defense spending. Johnson also backs Trump's forced peace plan for Ukraine, stating he does 'not have an appetite for further Ukraine funding' and expressing confidence that Trump can end the war by pushing for negotiations with Russia.\nRead also: Opinion: Aid to Ukraine is now a 2-way street empowering US drone warfare\nWhile most Senate Republicans support NATO and aid to Ukraine, their stance could clash with Trump, Vance, and Johnson's agenda. These differences could lead to friction between the White House, House, and Senate.\nThe Trump-Vance administration is poised to reduce U.S. involvement in NATO and foreign conflicts. Trump, Vance, and Johnson argue that the U.S. has done enough for Ukraine and Europe. They intend to work with Russia on a peace agreement that may require Ukraine to adopt neutrality and forego NATO membership.\nIn other words, Europe and Ukraine may soon find themselves without U.S. support. Facing Russian aggression alone, European nations and Ukraine will have to strengthen their cooperation and resilience amid an increasingly uncertain future. Only time will reveal whether they will succeed.\nEditor's Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.\nSubmit an Opinion\nIntroducing official\nmerch from the Kyiv Independent\nShop now\nWe've been working hard to bring you independent, locally-sourced news from Ukraine.

        "summary": "Donald Trump's quirky dance moves on the campaign trail have become the latest celebration craze in sports.\nNFL stars, UFC great Jon 'Bones' Jones, and college football players have recently danced like Trump, turning their highlight plays into viral moments.\nLas Vegas Raiders rookie sensation Brock Bowers was the latest to celebrate his touchdown score Sunday with a Trump dance in a 34-19 loss to the Miami Dolphins as his postgame media availability ended.\n\"I've seen everyone do it,\" Bowers told USA TODAY Sports, answering the last question of his postgame media availability. \"I watched the UFC fight [Saturday] night and Jon Jones did it. I like watching UFC so I saw it, and thought it was cool.\"\nAlong with Bowers, Detroit Lions defenders Za'Darius Smith and Malcolm Rodriguez celebrated a stop, while Tennessee Titans players Calvin Ridley and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine prematurely celebrated a touchdown Sunday.\nIt's a simple routine: Bend your elbows, close your fists, and move your arms back and forth as the Trump vibes flow. Add head-tiling and facial expressions for some flair.\nTrump often performed the stiff boogie down that stole the show during campaign rallies across the country en route to winning the 2024 presidential election over Vice President Kamala Harris.\nNow, a silly dance has become the latest intersection between sports and politics.\nTrump was sitting ringside and appeared amused as Jones playfully gestured his iteration of the Trump dance twice at UFC 309 in Madison Square Garden.\n'I'm proud to be a great American champion. I'm proud to be a Christian American champion,' Jones said in his post-fight interview.\nThis latest Trump foray into sports is a far cry from just seven years ago when Trump accused NFL players of disrespecting the American flag by kneeling during the National Anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice.\nNow, NFL athletes are being reposted and shared on the social media accounts of the 45th and 47th president.\nSan Francisco 49ers edge rusher Nick Bosa started the Trump dance trend in the NFL during his Nov. 10 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, celebrating a sack with teammates Leonard Floyd, Sam Okuayinonu and Fred Warner.\nBosa's dance earned him a shoutout from Trump on social media network Truth Social.\n'I think you know the answer to that question,' Bosa told the San Francisco Chronicle last week when asked his inspiration for the Trump dance. 'All the guys wanted me to do it. I wasn't even going to do it, but the boys reminded me. And it was fun.'\nWest Virginia's Nicco Marchiol also had his Trump dance posted by Trump on social media on Nov. 12.\nDrake University's Trey Radocha, Northern Illinois University's Tristen Tewes and University of Texas defender Michael Taaffee have also celebrated with Trump dances during games. East Carolina quarterback Katin Houser may have started the trend in college with his celebration two days after the Nov. 5 election.\nIt's no surprise the Trump dance has become viral. As much as the 78-year-old Trump has been divisive when it comes to politics, he's been ingrained in pop culture for much of his life.\nThe Trump dance is challenging the political idea of athletes not 'sticking to sports' with a silly dance that's seems to be sticking around.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Brock Bowers' trump dance latest viral NFL celebration",

        "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump confirmed Monday that his plan for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants will involve a national emergency declaration and the military. Trump, in an early-morning post on social media, responded 'TRUE!!!' to a conservative activist who said he had heard such reports. Trump, meanwhile, is preparing to roll out more Cabinet picks in the coming days after several of his earlier choices have come under intense scrutiny, including his choices of former congressman Matt Gaetz (R-Florida) for attorney general and Fox News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary.\n9:32 AM: Activist group plans for Trump resistance 2.0\nDemocrats' reaction to Donald Trump's second election has been largely that of confusion, resignation and somberness. It's a far cry from his election in 2016, when activists mobilized fiercely and immediately. Remember the Women's March that brought hundreds of thousands of people to the National Mall the day after Trump's inauguration?\nIndivisible, a leading Trump resistance group formed in 2016, is unveiling its action plan for a second Trump term. It is calling on the 15 states that have a Democratic governor and legislature \u2014 including California, Washington, Colorado, Illinois, New York and Maryland \u2014 to 'Trump-proof' their states.\nRedirecting their focus to states is Democrats' only avenue for at least the first two years of Trump's term, with Republicans winning control of the Senate and the House, albeit by slim majorities. (Republicans currently have 218 House seats, the minimum needed for a majority.)\nSome examples include:\nIndivisible is calling on its activists to write to the Democratic governors and encourage them to be bold in the face of a Trump agenda. 'Blue areas have enormous power to shape the terms of the national debate, to leverage their economic and political power to protect the things we care about, and to pick fights that help us highlight the rotten core of Project 2025. And you have a crucial role in ensuring they do it,' said Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin, Indivisible co-executive directors and authors of the report.\nBy: Theodoric Meyer and Leigh Ann Caldwell\n9:10 AM: These are the environmental rules that will likely outlive Trump\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has vowed to dismantle much of President Joe Biden's climate legacy \u2014 but there's one set of environmental policies that will be hard to reverse.\nThe Biden administration has set new energy efficiency standards for two dozen appliances, from air conditioners to microwaves. The rules would require companies to find ways to make dishwashers, dryers and other new appliances use less energy \u2014 for example, by adding better insulation or using more advanced parts.\nRead the full story\nBy: Nicol\u00e1s Rivero\n8:39 AM: Trump confirms mass deportations will involve national emergency, military\nPresident-elect Donald Trump confirmed Monday that his plan for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants will involve a national emergency declaration and the military.\nTrump, in an early-morning post on social media, responded 'TRUE!!!' to a Nov. 8 post from Tom Fitton, a Trump ally who leads the conservative legal group Judicial Watch.\n'GOOD NEWS: Reports are the incoming @RealDonaldTrump administration prepared to declare a national emergency and will use military assets to reverse the Biden invasion through a mass deportation program,' Fitton wrote.\nA Trump transition spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe proposal for mass deportations was one of Trump's top campaign promises and was reflected in the earliest appointments that he announced for his incoming administration.\nHe picked Tom Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to be his 'border czar' and help oversee the deportations. Homan has said 'public safety threats and national security threats' will be prioritized in the deportations. He has also promised to resume workplace immigration raids.\nDuring his first term, Trump declared a national emergency on the border in an effort to bypass Congress and tap the Pentagon budget for money to build a border wall. Democrats criticized the move as unconstitutional and even some Republicans expressed unease with it. President Joe Biden rescinded the order shortly after he took office in 2020.\nBy: Patrick Svitek\n8:28 AM: Analysis: RFK Jr. vs. Big Pharma vs. Big Food\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has antagonized the food and drug industries in recent weeks, blaming them for the prevalence of chronic disease and childhood illness in the United States.\nNow, he's poised to wield enormous power over both if confirmed to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The drug industry is scrambling to measure the potential damage he could inflict on one of his favorite targets: the Food and Drug Administration.\nRead the full story\nBy: Rachel Roubein\n8:15 AM: 'Morning Joe' hosts say they met with Trump to 'restart communications'\nJoe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, the hosts of MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' who have been highly critical of Donald Trump, said they met with the president-elect on Friday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\nBrzezinski said it was the first time they had seen him in seven years, and Scarborough said they 'talked about a lot of issues, including abortion, mass deportation, threats of political retribution against political opponents and media outlets.' The hosts revealed the meeting during their show Monday morning.\n'We didn't see eye-to-eye on a lot of issues, and we told him so,' Scarborough said. Brzezinski added that they did agree to 'restart communications' as his second term approaches.\nA Trump transition spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n'Morning Joe' hosted Trump for interviews during the 2016 presidential campaign, but his relationship with the hosts fractured during his presidency and its aftermath. The show is now a platform for regular criticism of Trump.\nScarborough and Brzezinski suggested the Nov. 5 election results \u2014 in which Trump won the popular vote and carried every battleground state \u2014 caused them to reassess their roles as journalists and commentators.\n'Joe and I realized it's time to do something different, and that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump, but also talking with him,' Brzezinski said.\nScarborough added that they are not looking to 'defend or normalize' Trump but to report on him.\nBy: Patrick Svitek\n7:51 AM: California's leading liberals are preparing to 'Trump-proof' their state\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Within hours of Donald Trump's victory this month, California's top elected officials readied themselves to reprise familiar roles as leaders of the Democratic resistance.\nGov. Gavin Newsom called a special session of the state legislature to discuss the best ways of 'Trump-proofing' California and traveled to Washington to ask for President Joe Biden's help.\nRead the full story\nBy: Reis Thebault\n7:31 AM: Analysis from Patrick Svitek\nRep.

        "excerpt": "Exclusive: 43 percent of Republicans were surprised by the election result \u2013 while most Americans think their neighbor voted for Trump",
        "summary": "Over half of Americans were surprised by Donald Trump's win in the presidential election \u2014 including 43 percent of Republicans, according to exclusive data.\nA poll of 1,941 US adults by Prolific, exclusively for The Independent, found that, following months of predictions on a knife's edge, Americans on all sides ended up being surprised by the final outcome of the White House race.\nSome 54 percent of people were at least quite surprised by the outcome of the election, with 14 percent of those 'very surprised.' A third were not very surprised, and 16 percent not surprised at all.\nAndrew Gordon, researcher at Prolific, explained that this surprise correlates to difficulties with polling in a polarized environment.\n'The fact that over half of voters, including 43 percent of Republicans, were surprised by the election outcome likely reflects the growing gap between perception and reality in our media-driven environment,' he said.\n'The level of surprise underscores the limitations of polling and media narratives in accurately capturing the public sentiment, especially when polarization is high.'\nAmong Republicans, whose party saw success in the presidential race, as well as in the House and Senate races, 43 percent said they were surprised by the outcome while 8 percent were 'very surprised.'\nOn the other hand, 35 percent of Republicans were not very surprised that Trump won, and 23 percent were not at all surprised.\nThe poll also found that the vast majority of Americans (78 percent) believe that Trump is more powerful now than in his first term.\nThis belief transcends party lines; for some, this may be more positive than others, said Gordon.\n'The widespread agreement that Trump is more powerful now than in 2016 highlights his transformation to a central figure in American political identity. For the US, Trump's growing influence may highlight the ever-extending risk polarization and the rise of personality-driven politics,' he told TheIndependent.\nWhen Trump won in 2016, he took the electoral college but fell short in the popular vote. The Supreme Court was also relatively evenly split between more liberal and conservative judges at the time.\nThis year's election gave Trump and Republicans a win in the electoral college, popular vote, House, and Senate. In addition, five out of eight justices on the Supreme Court are considered more conservative; meaning that a Republican agenda may face less friction in the courts.\n'For the Republican Party, Trump's dominance has left no question over its current and future direction, but it may have come at the cost of alienating moderates and traditional conservatives,' said Gordon.\n'The focus on Trump-centric politics within the party risks narrowing the party's appeal and in the long term, the party must decide whether to double down on Trump's particular brand of politics or embrace a broader, more classical, Republican approach.'\nIn terms of the popular vote, both Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris had a relatively even split.\nJust 2.7 million more people voted for Trump than Harris, at 50 percent and 48.3 percent respectively.\nDespite this fractional difference, the survey found that a majority (55 percent) of Americans now believe their neighbor voted for Trump; just a third think their neighbor voted for Harris.\nThere appears to be a dissonance between the two parties, too.\nDemocrats are only slightly more likely to think that their neighbor voted for Harris (45 percent) than Trump (41 percent).\nMeanwhile, an overwhelming majority (74 percent) of Republicans believe that their neighbor also supported Trump, compared to just 17 percent Harris.\nUltimately, with such a tight race, the likelihood is that every second person voted for Trump or Harris. So why is it that Trump seems the more obvious choice?\nThere could be several reasons for this.\nOne possible explanation is that Trump dominated in most rural areas, with large stretches of the electoral map being red.\nIt may therefore be more likely for Republicans living in those areas to safely assume their neighbors voted Trump rather than Harris.\nYet while there may be some Harris voters in their midst, silent voting within communities is no new phenomenon, and even at times extends to secret votes within families.\n'For Republicans, this could signal a sense of solidarity within communities where Trump's messaging resonates. Alternatively, it could indicate an overestimation of Trump's support due to the boldness and visibility of his base,' suggested Gordon.\n'It may also hint at a certain level of social desirability bias, where people feel more comfortable attributing conservative leanings to others than admitting them themselves.'\nBy the same token , it may be harder to see why so many Democrats think their neighbor voted Trump. But that can also be partially explained by geography.\nTypically, Democrats perform better in many cities across the US.\nThis year, however, Trump made significant gains in several cities, not least flipping Miami-Dade County for the first time in nearly four decades.\nEven in the blue cities of New York and Chicago, Trump made astonishing inroads in what were considered safe Democrat areas.\nThis transition could also mean that Democrats residing in cities are more uncertain of how their neighbors voted.",

Back in October, three weeks before the 2024 Presidential Election, Trump's crypto bank, World Liberty Financial, previewed Trump's own crypto coin.\nAs for Bakkt, which was founded in 2018 and is based in Alpharetta, Georgia, the platform works to offer crypto investors technical services.

        "summary": "(JTA) \u2014 Stephen Miller. David Friedman. Jared. Ivanka.\nThese names, and a few others, became familiar to American Jews over the four years of the first Donald Trump White House. Depending on the day, and their political views, Jews looked on them with pride or scorn, hope or disappointment. In addition to shaping the course of the first Trump administration, they became symbols of and conduits for the president's relationship with the Jewish community.\nNow, four years later, as Trump prepares to reenter the White House, some of that cast of characters is back while others have dropped off the stage. Other Jewish figures are making their entrances for the first time. Some come from Trump's time in the worlds of media and business, others from his decade in politics, still others from his family.\nHere are the Jews to know in Donald Trump's inner circle.\nJared Kushner and Ivanka Trump\nNo two Jews drew more attention than Trump's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Coming to the White House from the social circles of wealthy New York City millennial life, the couple was seen as a relatively liberal, moderating influence on a president who had never before held office.\nThey both served as White House advisers and took central roles in the administration. Kushner, in particular, had a wide-ranging portfolio spanning everything from negotiating a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada to running Trump's 2020 reelection campaign to brokering the normalization agreements between Israel and several Arab states known as the Abraham Accords.\nThey were also, in some ways, the Jewish face of the administration, making appearances at Jewish sites and hosting members of the cabinet for Shabbat dinner. Particularly at the beginning of Trump's term, their Jewish observance \u2014 they have attended Orthodox synagogues and send their kids to Jewish day school \u2014 drew curiosity and scrutiny.\nAfter Trump's 2020 loss, the family moved to Miami and sat out Trump's most recent reelection campaign. Ivanka, who campaigned with her father during his previous two electoral campaigns, said after Trump's campaign announcement in 2022 that she and Kushner would step back to focus on family life. Kushner said he would focus on his business and the couple's children.\nKushner suggested to The New York Times late last month that the pair would remain outside of politics if Trump won the election, though more recent reports suggest he may be involved in some way with Trump's Middle East policy. During the campaign, the couple appeared at several events, including the Republican National Convention and Trump's victory party.\nThey were not entirely separated from their work during the first Trump administration. Kushner runs a multi-billion dollar investment firm tied to Arab states in the Gulf, raising ethical concerns about overlapping with government affairs. The Democrat-led Senate Finance Committee opened an investigation into Kushner's firm in June, though its future is uncertain.\nStephen Miller\nStephen Miller \u2014 one of Trump's most hardline advisers on immigration during his first term, and one of that White House's most polarizing figures \u2014 will serve as Trump's deputy chief of staff in his next term.\nDuring Trump's first term, Miller was an architect of some of the administration's most divisive actions on immigration, including the family separation policy and the travel ban on a number of Muslim-majority countries. A broad range of Jewish officials and groups criticized those policies and called for Miller's resignation.\nOver the last four years since Trump was voted out, Miller launched a firm called America First Legal that bills itself as a conservative response to the ACLU, and was involved in Project 2025, the controversial compilation of proposals for a second Trump term. He and his wife, who wed in 2020, have also had three children.\nThis year, Miller campaigned for Trump, and used nativist rhetoric at Trump's controversial rally in Madison Square Garden last month.\n'America is for Americans and Americans only,' Miller said, adding that U.S. citizens were having their jobs 'looted and stolen.'\nIn an interview last week with Fox News, Miller said Trump would begin deporting undocumented immigrants immediately after taking office. In multiple interviews, he has outlined plans to deport millions of migrants, renewing Jewish groups' concerns.\n'The invasion will end the instant that he takes the oath of office,' Miller said.\nDavid Friedman\nDavid Friedman, who worked as Trump's bankruptcy lawyer before 2016, was ambassador to Israel during his first administration.\nFriedman did not have foreign policy experience before becoming ambassador in 2017, and had been a supporter of Israeli West Bank settlements before entering office. As ambassador, he was a key part of the team that fulfilled a long wish list of Israeli government priorities \u2014 from moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem to brokering the Abraham Accords.\nFriedman criticized his former boss for his 2022 meeting with Kanye West and Nick Fuentes, then two of the most prominent people spouting antisemitic rhetoric. 'To my friend Donald Trump, you are better than this,' Friedman tweeted after that meeting.\nBut he says he subsequently spoke with Trump and endorsed the former president's reelection campaign, citing Trump's 'historic achievements' as president, and his support for Israel.\nFriedman has pushed for Israeli annexation of the West Bank. He recently released a book arguing for Israeli control over the entire territory.\nFriedman will not be reprising his role in Trump's second term; Trump announced on Tuesday that former Gov. Mike Huckabee will be the next U.S. ambassador to Israel. Friedman said he was 'thrilled' by Huckabee's appointment.\nSteve Witkoff\nSteve Witkoff, a real estate businessman and Trump's golf buddy, will be the Middle East envoy in the president-elect's coming term.\nIn that role, Witkoff, 67, will take the spot occupied by Jason Greenblatt in the first part of Trump's first term. In that role, Greenblatt conducted negotiations with leaders across the region. As was the case when Greenblatt entered the administration, Witkoff has no Middle East diplomatic experience.\nWitkoff has been friends with Trump since the 1980s, when he bought Trump a sandwich after they worked on a real estate transaction. Witkoff has also praised Trump for his friendship after one of Witkoff's sons, Andrew, died at a rehab facility.\nTrump said Witkoff was playing golf with him when Secret Service agents fired at someone who was allegedly preparing to kill Trump. He and his son Zach spoke at the Republican convention in July.\nMiriam Adelson\nMiriam Adelson, a prolific donor to Republican, pro-Israel and Jewish causes, is carrying on the legacy she built with her late husband, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.\nAdelson has remained a force in Republican politics, and has stayed close to Trump, since her husband's death in 2021. She donated $100 million to a campaign committee supporting Trump's candidacy. (Her estimated net worth is $35 billion.) During the campaign, she introduced Trump before he gave a speech on fighting antisemitism.\nAdelson was born in Tel Aviv and reportedly spends much of her time in Israel. She is the publisher of the country's largest print newspaper, Israel Hayom, which her husband founded.\nBoris Epshteyn\nBoris Epshteyn is a longtime aide to Trump and political strategist. He often spoke for Trump on television during the 2016 campaign and advised his 2024 campaign.\nEpshteyn served as a special assistant in the Trump administration during Trump's first term and reportedly wrote a controversial statement for Holocaust Remembrance Day in 2017 that did not mention Jews.\nEpshteyn, an investment banker and finance attorney, also collaborated with Rudy Giuliani on trying unsuccessfully to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and appeared with Trump in court in New York last year. Epshteyn was charged with felonies for election tampering in Arizona earlier this year and pleaded not guilty.\nEpshteyn moved to the United States from his native Moscow in 1993 at the age of 11. He was previously a communications aide for Sen. John McCain's 2008 campaign for president.\nThis week, Epshteyn was on Trump's airplane with the president-elect, Elon Musk and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz when Trump decided to nominate Gaetz, a Florida Republican who once invited a Holocaust denier to the State of the Union, as his attorney general. He has reportedly sparred with Musk over decisions during the presidential transition, and The New York Times reported that he has floated himself as Trump's special envoy for the war in Ukraine.\nHoward Lutnick\nHoward Lutnick, the billionaire head of finance firm Cantor Fitzgerald, is the co-chair of Trump's transition team.\nHe raised campaign funds for Trump and has taken on a prominent role on the president-elect's team in recent months, speaking for Trump in the media, and earning plaudits from Trump family members and the campaign.\nHe has been in touch with Kushner about hiring and Musk about budget policy, The Wall Street Journal reported. The Washington Post has reported that Lutnick is a candidate for treasury secretary, though more recently, The New York Times reported that Lutnick 'has gotten on Mr. Trump's nerves lately.'\nLutnick is a supporter of pro-Israel causes including the first responder group United Hatzalah and Birthright, which organizes free 10-day trips to the country.\nA New York native, Lutnick accompanied Trump to the grave of the late spiritual leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, last month.\nElizabeth Pipko\nElizabeth Pipko, a GOP spokesperson from New York, is one of Trump's leading Jewish surrogates.\nPipko is a former model and often advocates for Jewish and pro-Israel causes. She was born to a family of immigrants from the former Soviet Union who settled in New York. Pipko grew up in New York City, where she attended the Orthodox Park East Day School in Manhattan. A rabbi from Park East Synagogue officiated her 2019 wedding, which took place at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida resort.\nPipko was a staffer for Trump's 2016 campaign. She said later that she had kept the position secret because she feared it would hurt her modeling career due to animosity toward Trump in the modeling world.\nIn 2019, Pipko was a spokesperson for a group called Jexodus that encouraged young Jews to leave the Democratic Party. Over the last year, she has spoken frequently about antisemitism on college campuses.\nPipko told Israel's Channel 12 news on Wednesday that Trump wants Israel's war in Gaza to end 'as soon as possible' with a 'decisive victory.'\nLee Zeldin\nAs a congressman representing a Long Island, New York, district from 2015 to 2023, and as one of two Jews in Congress at the time, Lee Zeldin was an avid defender of Trump.\nZeldin kept a distance from Trump, who was then unpopular in New York, during his 2022 gubernatorial campaign. During that campaign, Zeldin leaned into his Jewish background to rally Orthodox communities, telling voters in Brooklyn about how his grandfather founded a synagogue and how his mother taught at a Brooklyn yeshiva.\nBut after he lost, he joined the board of the Republican Jewish Coalition and maintained ties with Trump and his reelection campaign. He was an early endorser of Trump's bid to retake the White House.\nThis week, Trump rewarded Zeldin by choosing him to helm the Environmental Protection Agency. While in Congress, Zeldin mainly voted against environmental protection legislation.\nLaura Loomer\nLaura Loomer, a Jewish far-right firebrand who once was the Republican nominee for a Florida congressional seat, has long come close to Trump but never worked for him.\nTrump endorsed her 2020 run for Congress and nearly hired her as a campaign aide a year ago but was dissuaded by his aides from doing so. They were concerned about her record of racist and bigoted comments about Muslims and others.\nOver the course of the campaign, Loomer began spending more time with Trump and traveled on his plane to Philadelphia to join him for the September presidential debate. Her presence and her racist comments about Kamala Harris drew criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has herself been accused of hate speech (against Jews).\nLoomer more recently drew criticism from within the party for criticizing Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., whom Trump has nominated as health secretary. She has not been rumored to be under consideration for any roles in the Trump administration.\nSid Rosenberg\nSid Rosenberg, a New York shock jock, said he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 but soon became a Trump convert, after initially dismissing his seriousness as a candidate. On his show, he has backed Trump and his policies, including seeking to eject migrants from the United States.\nRosenberg become a pro-Israel advocate after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. He vaulted into national prominence last month when he appeared at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally, where he mocked comparisons between the rally and one held by American Nazis there in 1939.\nThis week, he joked with Tulsi Gabbard on his show about becoming White House press secretary under Trump. (Gabbard said his daily briefings would require an R rating.) Gabbard \u2014 a former Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate who has opposed U.S. support for Ukraine and has promoted conspiracy theories \u2014 was picked to become Trump's national intelligence director the next day. Rosenberg's joking proposal, meanwhile, did not come to fruition: Trump named Karoline Leavitt as his press secretary on Friday.\nWill Scharf\nWill Scharf, who has worked as an attorney for Trump and defended him on TV, has been chosen as White House staff secretary, a key role managing which information the president sees.\nScharf, 38, was raised modern Orthodox in New York City and Florida, according to a 2023 profile in Jewish Insider, and attended Phillips Academy in Andover, an elite non-Jewish private prep school in Massachusetts. He told Jewish Insider that he lays tefillin every day and attends Shabbat services at Chabad.\nHe ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for Missouri attorney general this year after serving as a federal prosecutor. He has also worked as a lawyer in Trump's criminal proceedings this year and \u2014 during the first Trump administration \u2014 worked on the efforts to confirm Supreme Court Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh.\nIn 2023, after announcing his attorney general campaign, Scharf co-founded Jews Against Soros, a group dedicated to combating the Jewish liberal megadonor and what it called his 'nefarious' and 'radical' agenda. Soros, who is Hungarian-American and survived the Holocaust as a child, is one of the prime targets of antisemitism on the right, but Scharf and his co-founder, hardline right-wing commentator Josh Hammer, said one of the group's goals was to dispel the idea that criticizing Soros is antisemitic. The group's website now appears to be inactive.\nTrump called Scharf a 'highly skilled attorney who will be a crucial part of my White House team.' In his role, he will control the flow of memos and documents to Trump's desk.\nMarc Rowan\nRowan, a billionaire Wall Street investor, has become one of the most prominent voices in a revolt of Ivy League donors pushing their alma maters to take campus antisemitism more seriously.\nNow, Rowan is reportedly on President-elect Donald Trump's shortlist for treasury secretary, a position that would allow him to bring his financial experience and pro-Israel leanings to the White House.\nTrump is expected to invite Rowan \u2013 whose Apollo Global Management manages around $733 billion in assets \u2013 to Mar-a-Lago this week for an interview, according to The New York Times.\nRowan, 62, grew up in a Jewish family on Long Island, the grandson of a New York University economics professor named Emanuel Stein who was known for quoting the Talmud, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nHe co-founded Apollo in 1990, and has become a fixture on Wall Street as well as in philanthropic circles, serving as board chair of New York's UJA-Federation. He is personally worth more than $6 billion, according to Forbes.\nHe drew broader attention after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, when he lambasted the way his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, was responding to Hamas' attack.\n'Microaggressions are condemned with extreme moral outrage and yet violence, particularly violence against Jews, antisemitism, seems to have found a place of tolerance on the campus,' Rowan told CNBC days after the Hamas attack, adding that donors should cut contributions to Penn \u2014 an early example of a prominent Jewish business figure using their sway to combat campus anti-Israel activism after Oct. 7.",

        "summary": "The world's richest man has appointed himself Donald Trump 's ' first buddy ' as he plays an influential role shaping the incoming administration, but tension between Trump's closest allies and Elon Musk is reportedly boiling over.\nMusk is clashing with longtime Trump attorney and adviser Boris Epshteyn, including questioning his influence in president-elect's nominations for his Cabinet and top White House jobs, Axios has reported, citing people familiar with the conversations.\nThe billionaire accused Epshteyn of leaking information about Trump's transition process, including personnel picks, during a 'massive blowup' and a 'huge explosion' between the two men during a dinner in front of guests at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, according to Axios.\n'You don't know what you're talking about,' Epshteyn reportedly fired back.\nMusk has reportedly criticized Epshteyn's influence in selecting nominations for the Department of Justice, including far-right congressman Matt Gaetz for attorney general.\nTesla's CEO has also pushed for Trump's transition team co-chair Howard Lutnick for Treasury secretary, over favored Wall Street veteran Scott Bessent. He also praised a foreign leader's decision to cut tariffs \u2014 the same Trump wants to raise in the US to the highest levels in decades.\n'Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas [Lutnick] will actually enact change,' Musk posted on his X platform. 'Business-as-usual is driving America bankrupt.'\nThe apparent rivalry between the billionaire, who funneled nearly $120 million into Trump's campaign, and one of Trump's most loyal advisers appears to have provoked Trump's inner circle, already reportedly growing annoyed with Musk's presence.\nEpshteyn has remained a key legal ally to the former president after joining a spurious campaign to overturn election results in 2020, and has remained a close adviser through his 2024 campaign and post-election transition.\nAxios' report comes days after a person familiar with the Trump transition told NBC News that Musk has been 'behaving as if he's a co-president and making sure everyone knows it' while also 'taking lots of credit for the president's victory. Bragging about America PAC and X to anyone who will listen.'\nMusk, meanwhile, is set to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy; both have pledged to recommend mass firings and drastic spending cuts across the federal government.\nThe billionaire has also joined meetings with Trump and his advisers discussing Cabinet appointments as well as a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nMusk also stands to benefit from Trump's incoming administration, as his business empire faces regulatory scrutiny under President Joe BIden's administration with ties to Russia and China potentially facing investigations.\nSpaceX has been awarded roughly $16 billion in federal contracts since 2017, according to government records. The company could see a massive boom if Trump commits to a pledge to expand space investments. Trump praised SpaceX at his campaign rallies and committed several minutes to talking about the company and Musk during his election night victory speech.\nThe Independent has requested comment from Musk and Trump's transition team.",

        "summary": "Sarah Palin appears to be venting her frustration over not receiving one of Donald Trump's coveted cabinet spots after supporting the President-elect throughout his campaign. The former Alaska governor, an early and vocal supporter of Trump since at least 2011, made a series of cryptic posts to social media with screengrabs of other users who were questioning why she had not been drafted into his Cabinet.\nIn one Sunday post announcing breaking news of a Trump nominee, Palin posted a screengrab of a text message with someone asking her: 'What about you?' to which she replied 'Thank you.' In another frame, she posted a selfie looking calm while writing the pointed yet exasperated words: 'Funny how politics work.'\nPalin also posted a rant by one of her supporters to her X and Instagram stories that labelled her as 'Trump before Trump', wondering aloud why she hadn't been given any kind of role. 'Currently, President elect Trump has named his secretaries for the VA, Energy, Interior and EPA administrator. Any one of these positions I hoped Sarah Palin would get,' the user wrote online.\n'Palin was Trump before Trump. I have been saying this for years. Sarah Palin is the Mother of MAGA. Back then [16 years ago], she was the face of the tea party, what would then become the MAGA movement. It is so shocking to me how in 2017, and now it looks like in 2025, she will not get a seat at the table that she helped set,' they added.\nIndeed, many Republicans believed Palin to have been a shoo-in candidate for a prominent role in the Trump administration. The one-time vice-presidential nominee was widely expected to land a high-profile position, potentially as Secretary of the Interior or another cabinet seat, given her outspoken support for Trump over the years.\nDuring his 2016 presidential bid she appeared at rallies and delivered speeches touting Trump's outsider appeal and conservative credentials. Her endorsement was seen as a major boost for Trump in his effort to secure the Republican nomination. Palin's endorsement this time around also helped to energize Trump's base, particularly among rural and conservative voters.\nShe appeared with Trump at a rally when he visited her home state of Alaska in 2022 and most recently was present at one of his final rallies at Madison Square Garden in New York last month. Yet, despite her loyalty, the anticipated reward - a seat at Trump's decision-making table - has yet to materialize.\nTrump's Cabinet announcements have so far leaned heavily on both establishment figures and political newcomers, leaving little room for firebrands like Palin. While speculation about who will fill key roles continues to dominate the headlines, Palin's omission from any shortlist has been particularly conspicuous.\nDespite the apparent snub, she remains a potent force in conservative politics. Fans of Palin hope she might still play a significant role in the Trump era, perhaps as a media firebrand or a grassroots organizer.\nHer message, while laced with frustration, may also signal that she's not stepping away quietly. Palin's next move remains a mystery, but as her social media posts to her 1.7 million followers gain traction, with at least 13 key positions in Trump's cabinet left to fill, there may yet be a place for Palin.\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Joe and I realize it's time to do something different, and that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump, but also talking with him.\"\nShe added that Trump came across as cheerful, and open to working with Democrats on key issues.\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

        "excerpt": "Although India has developed a strong relationship with President-elect Trump, other South Asian countries may struggle to gain a hearing in his second term.",
        "summary": "During the first Trump administration, South Asia, particularly India, fared relatively well in its relations with Washington. President Trump appeared to develop a personal relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2014the two leaders share somewhat similar transactional worldviews\u2014and Trump hosted Modi at a large event in Texas. Pakistan did not enjoy the same warmth from the United States as India did in Trump's first term, but Washington and Islamabad collaborated on the peace process in Afghanistan and addressed a range of other issues in the latter half of Trump's term. Meanwhile, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka faced challenges balancing their ties with China against the Trump administration's focus on India. The United States encouraged smaller states in the region to follow India's lead by strengthening defense ties with Washington and reducing their reliance on China.\nIn the second term, India is preparing for more of the same. Trump is likely to continue his close personal links with Prime Minister Modi. Since Trump last left office, India has become a more prominent player in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue and other U.S. Indo-Pacific regional arrangements. The series of China hawks Trump has appointed to many, if not all, of the senior national security positions, strongly suggest a very tough policy toward Beijing\u2014one that would likely further strengthen ties with India.\nThe fact that India has continued to pursue ties with Russia since the Ukraine war, a sticking point in U.S.-India ties during the Biden administration, is unlikely to hinder relations between Washington and New Delhi under Trump, either. Trump occasionally criticized India over tariff issues, becoming particularly fixated on tariffs that affect the iconic Harley-Davidson motorcycle brand. Like many other countries, his proposed tariffs could impact India, but it remains unclear whether these proposals were merely campaign rhetoric.\nHowever, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Pakistan have reason to be more cautious about a second Trump term. A leftist government now runs Sri Lanka, which has had links to radical left-leaning organizations since the 1970s. This true outsider government has come into office with a mandate to upend Sri Lankan politics and its economy dramatically. While it might see some comfort in a second Trump administration's shared concerns about Beijing, overall, the worldview of the new Sri Lankan government is miles from that of the new Trump administration. The Trump White House also tends to pay less attention to smaller states, and with so many ongoing world crises, Sri Lanka could easily get ignored.\nBangladesh, having recently overthrown its former government and striving to rebuild its society and political system, received strong support from the Biden administration. Conversely, Trump has condemned the killing of Hindus in Bangladesh's communal violence and may seek to punish Bangladesh simply because its caretaker government was close to Biden. Trump's pick for Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has also harshly criticized the treatment of Hindus in Bangladesh.\nAs The Diplomat noted, the head of the caretaker government, Muhamad Yunus, speaking at a conference in Paris, compared the Trump re-election result to 'a solar eclipse,' adding that 'Trump's win has hit us so hard that\u2026 I could hardly speak. I lost all strength.' Bangladesh, which depends on its export-oriented garment industry, could be badly damaged by even modest tariffs imposed by the second Trump administration.\nAs for Pakistan, Gabbard has harshly slammed the Pakistan army for its treatment of Hindus in the past and appears highly critical of the country. (To be sure, it remains unclear whether the Senate will confirm Gabbard.) The same hawkish appointees do not look favorably on China's longstanding and close friend, Pakistan, either. Mike Waltz, the incoming national security advisor, was co-chair of the congressional India Caucus and is known to have strong and negative views about Pakistan's role in regional security. Like its South Asian neighbors other than India, Pakistan appears headed for major challenges with Trump 2.0.",

        "excerpt": "President-elect Donald Trump was recently referred to as a 'mythical character' by a Hollywood A-lister.",
        "summary": "Hollywood legend Sylvester Stallone has recently joined the growing list of celebrities to back US President-elect Donald Trump. Stallone drew comparisons between Trump and some of history's most iconic figures. At the America First Policy Institute Gala last week, Stallone described Trump as a 'mythical character,' and gave him a new nickname\u2014 \"the second George Washington.\" The actor also compared the Republican leader to Jesus Christ. Stallone, whose rise to fame coincided with Trump's early years as a real estate tycoon, praised the incoming president for his unique achievements, asserting that no one else could have accomplished what he has.\nStallone said, \"When George Washington defended his country, he had no idea that he was going to change the world. Because without him, you could imagine what the world would look like. Guess what? We got the second George Washington. Congratulations!\" As reported by Nicki Swift, he also compared Trump to Rocky Balboa. He stated, \"[Rocky] was a chosen person...Something was going to happen, this man was going to go through a metamorphosis. This man was going to change lives, just like President Trump.\"\nSylvester Stallone (@theslystallone) introduces President-elect Trump at the @A1Policy Gala. pic.twitter.com/mZQNXrSxm8\n\u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) November 15, 2024\nWhile Stallone was sure of Trump as president, netizens had mixed reactions. While some slammed Stallone, others celebrated the Rambo star's endorsement. An X user penned, \"Stallone said years ago in a bio that he would never state his political leanings so as not to alienate any fans. YO!!!\" Another chimed, \"I don't like Stallone anymore. First, I didn't like the way he talked about Tulsa in an interview. And now Trump?\"\nStallone said years ago in a bio that he would never state his political leanings so as not to alienate any fans. YO!!!\n\u2014 Reginald Greene (@Reginal93124196) November 15, 2024\nMeanwhile, a MAGA Trump fan remarked, \"Awesome! I am glad one person from Hollywood has the guts to admit Trump is what the USA needs!\" Stallone's remarks show a major shift after years of avoiding a public endorsement of Trump. Interestingly, he had even turned down a position in Trump's administration during his first term. In a 2016 interview, the actor praised Trump as someone bigger than life, comparing him to a great Dickensian character and the legendary Babe Ruth, as reported by HuffPost.\nAwesome! I'm glad one person from Hollywood has the guts to admit Trump is what the USA needs!\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Sly can't be bought!\n\u2014 Linda Klein (@Gigiluv115) November 15, 2024\nThe popular actor has also been a guest at Trump's lavish Mar-a-Lago New Year's Eve celebrations previously and even gave Trump a signed poster to celebrate his victory in the 2016 presidential election. On the other hand, Trump, who has publicly referred to Stallone as a friend and praised him as a 'wonderful guy,' is said to have privately shown signs of jealousy towards the actor. According to Ramin Setoodeh, co-editor-in-chief of Variety and author of Apprentice in Wonderland, Trump has reportedly expressed frustration over Stallone's former reality show The Contender. He also allegedly claimed that Stallone wasn't as skilled at producing television as he was with The Apprentice.",

Trump won a decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris on Nov. 5, sweeping the nation's battleground states and also clinching the first popular vote win for a Republican in 20 years.\nBrzezinski took a moment to respond to the viewers who may have been appalled that they would agree to speak with Trump, whom they've repeatedly described as a threat to democracy.\n\"For those asking why we would go speak to the president-elect during such fraught times, especially between us, I guess I would ask back \u2013 why wouldn't we?\" she said. \"Five years of political warfare has deeply divided Washington and the country. We have been as clear as we know how in expressing our deep concerns about President Trump's actions and words in the coarsening of public debate.\nBut for nearly 80 million Americans, election denialism, public trials, January 6th, were not as important as the issues that moved them to send Donald Trump back to the White House with their vote. Joe and I realize it's time to do something different, and that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump, but also talking with him.\"\nThe defensive tone about speaking to Trump was noteworthy given \"Morning Joe\" was upset by NBC's hiring of Trump ally Ronna McDaniel earlier this year as a paid analyst. The show and several other MSNBC luminaries publicly spoke about against McDaniel appearing on their airwaves, and her contract was terminated after less than a week.\nBrzezinski said Trump's term would be a \"consequential\" presidency, but time would tell if it was \"constructive.\" She railed against threatening political opponents and also noted that impeachments and trials tend to turn politicians into martyrs.\n\"Just ask Bill Clinton and Donald Trump,\" she said.\nScarborough noted that Trump can't seek another term so this could be an opportunity for \"both parties to get to work,\" and claimed top Democrats had confided to him they were open to working with Trump if the feeling was mutual.\n\"Don't be mistaken,\" Scarborough said. \"We're not here to defend or normalize Donald Trump. We're here to report on him and to hopefully provide you insights that are going to better equip all of us in understanding these deeply unsettling times.\"\nThat might not sit well with some of their fellow MSNBC hosts or liberal media colleagues.\nBrzezinski also revealed Monday that Scarborough called Trump the day after the assassination attempt against him in July, but other than that, they had not even spoken since 2020. MSNBC kept \"Morning Joe\" off the air the Monday after the shooting in a controversial move at the time.\nScarborough and Brzezinski, who are married, stood out in the 2016 cycle for their bullishness on Trump's political chances early in the Republican primary, and they took heat for frequently hosting and interviewing the future president. But they became two of his staunchest critics once he took office and Trump at times leveled intensely personal attacks on the pair.\nScarborough, a former Florida U.S. congressman, left the Republican Party in 2017 over his disagreements with Trump.",

They did an amazing job\u2014from the moment Biden drops out,\" he said on his podcast at the time.\nRogan said that he believed the difference in the debate was not \"who's going to have better policies\" or \"who's going to be better for the country,\" but it was down to which candidate was better prepared for the debate stage.\nHe added that Harris was way better prepared and that when it came to answering tough questions, she answered by \"saying things she believed, and they sounded real good\" rather than answering the questions.\nThe podcaster said that this skill was also proof that Harris was working with a team, in comparison to Trump, who he intimated did not prepare or work with a team.\nRogan then joked that Trump's team likely tried to warn him not to say \"people are eating cats and dogs,\" and made fun of the portion of the debate in which Trump referred to a since disproven rumor about Haitian illegal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, stealing and eating pets. The claims added to the debate over immigration policy, which is consistently among the top issues for U.S. voters.",

        "excerpt": "By appealing to Trump's vanity about his legacy, perhaps we can prevent his presidency from being a geopolitical nightmare",
        "summary": "The nightmare has arrived. Trump's 'America First' norm-flouting was bad enough the last time around, when a collection of traditional Republicans in senior positions moderated his worst impulses. No such grown-ups are expected to return.\nOur only hope may be that Trump no longer must worry about re-election. Instead of pandering to \u2013 and promoting \u2013 the worst instincts of his base, Trump, long preoccupied by his image, may begin to contemplate his legacy. Will history mock or admire him? The greater his concern with his lasting reputation, the better our chances of averting disaster.\nUkraine illustrates the choices ahead. Does Trump really want to be known as the Neville Chamberlain of the 21st century, appeasing a brutal tyrant in the naive hope that he will be sated with a single gulp of ill-gotten territory?\nFor reasons that are not wholly understood, Trump has long harbored an unseemly admiration for Vladimir Putin. Trump is likely to stop sending arms to Ukraine and to insist that Kyiv settle for at best a frozen conflict, in effect ceding its occupied eastern territory to Russia. But with Trump in the White House, Putin is likely to want more.\nBehind Putin's self-serving rhetoric about denazifying Ukraine is a desire to de-democratize it. A democratic Ukraine on Russia's border is a constant reminder to the Russian people of the freedoms that Putin's dictatorship denies them. He wants another Belarus.\nNo amount of strongman-admiration on Trump's part will overcome the Ukrainian people's refusal to become another Kremlin vassal state. Nor will it avoid Ukraine's understandable distrust of Putin and insistence on western security guarantees if there is to be any formal accord. Trump as Chamberlain would be indifferent to Kyiv's pleas. A Trump sensitive to his place in history might be more accommodating.\nMoreover, a humiliating surrender for Ukraine would hardly go unnoticed in Beijing. Trump might try to spin it as enabling greater focus on China, which he rightly sees as a threat, but Xi Jinping is likely to read it as a lack of resolve. If Trump will not defend an aspiring democracy on the threshold of the European Union, why would he prevent Beijing from incorporating Taiwan by threatened or actual force? Even close American allies such as Japan and South Korea would quickly recalibrate their need to accommodate Beijing. Is that what Trump wants to be remembered for?\nTrump mainly sees China as a commercial threat. Having hiked tariffs during his last presidency (Joe Biden maintained them), Trump now threatens to substantially increase them. He laughably claims that China would pay for the tariffs, ignoring the near-universal view of economists that the cost would be passed on to American consumers.\nTrump contends that tariffs would force more manufacturing to US soil, but a battle of tit-for-tat tariffs would more immediately fuel inflation. During the campaign, Trump played on many Americans' mistaken tendency to equate higher prices from past inflation with ongoing inflation, but they would soon appreciate the difference as prices again soared.\nBiden showed the way toward a smarter trade policy \u2013 one built on common values rather than mere competition \u2013 that Trump would be wise to continue and expand. Beyond subsidies, many Chinese producers exploit Beijing's use of Uyghur forced labor, especially in China's north-west province of Xinjiang. That forced labor infects exports of cotton, tomatoes, aluminum and, significantly, polysilicon, the building block of China's corner-the-market solar panels.\nBoth the US government and the European Union claim to oppose importing the product of forced labor, but only the United States has created a legislative presumption against any imports from Xinjiang without proof that forced labor was not involved \u2013 proof that is impossible to obtain given China's opaque supply chains. The EU never adopted that presumption, so imports from Xinjiang have surged, while US imports have diminished.\nA smart policy on trade with China would push the EU to adopt a similar presumption. Trump should also have US customs officials pay more attention to Beijing's subterfuges, such as shipping from Xinjiang via other parts of China or even third countries to avoid the presumption.\nIsrael's war in Gaza will demand a rethink from Trump. During his first term, he gave Benjamin Netanyahu whatever he wanted, from recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital to greenlighting rapid expansion of Israel's illegal (war-crime) settlements and refusing to call Palestinian land 'occupied'. Now, Trump says that Biden has imposed too many restraints on the Israeli prime minister \u2013 by pushing him to stop bombing and starving Palestinian civilians \u2013 even though Biden refused to use the leverage of conditioning US arms sales and military aid to enforce those demands. Trump wants to let Israel 'finish the job', ideally quickly, and told Netanyahu to 'do what you have to do'.\nBut an unrestrained Netanyahu might heed the calls of his rightwing ministers to force the mass deportation of the Palestinians of Gaza to Egypt \u2013 a trip that, like the Nakba of 1948, is likely to be one-way. That would outrage the world and almost surely yield additional war-crime charges from the international criminal court (ICC).\nDuring Trump's last term, he disgracefully imposed sanctions on the prior ICC prosecutor for opening investigations that could implicate Israeli officials in Palestinian territory as well as US torturers under George W Bush in Afghanistan. Biden lifted those sanctions, and even mainstream Republicans warmed to the court after its prosecutor charged Putin with war crimes in Ukraine. If Trump were to revive sanctions, he would virtually invite the prosecutor to abandon political restraints that keep him from charging senior US officials (soon, including Trump) for aiding and abetting Israeli war crimes in Gaza.\nTrump's desire to expand the Abraham Accords, perhaps the most visible foreign policy achievement of his first term, will also founder without a tougher approach to Israel. Although the Saudi crown prince is notoriously indifferent to the plight of Palestinians, Saudi public opinion has forced him to announce that, however much he wants the carrot of US security guarantees against Iran, he will not normalize relations with Israel without a firm path to a Palestinian state. That is anathema to the Israeli government. Trump must decide whether to abandon his reflexive support for Israel in favor of a deal that would indeed be historic.\nA similar dilemma faces Trump on Iran. His ripping up of Barack Obama's nuclear deal has put the clerics just a few short steps from a nuclear bomb. Netanyahu is itching for Trump to join him in a military attack on Iran's nuclear program, but that would risk involving American forces in a regional war that Trump wants to avoid. It would also endanger the Gulf states' oil supplies, fueling inflation. And it would only encourage Iran to obtain a ready-made nuclear weapon from, say, North Korea. Is that what Trump wants?\nMore broadly, Trump needs to decide whether to continue his professed admiration for the world's autocrats. He seems to relish their ability to act without the impediments of democratic checks and balances that so frustrated him during his first term.\nBut the autocrats have learned to play him. Trump can hardly trumpet his artful dealmaking when word is out that a round of calculated fawning is all it takes to manipulate his fragile ego. Will Trump be known for dispensing with the national interest in his quest for the sugar high of flattery? Despite his transactional, go-it-alone tendencies, even Trump might come to appreciate how few friends he has if he stands for little beyond a quest for praise.\nTrump might even reconsider his instinctive opposition to multilateral endeavors. Biden, sadly, has already done him the favor of abandoning the US seat on the UN human rights council. But does Trump really want to defund the World Health Organization again when it is the frontline for our defense against the next pandemic, whether bird flu, mpox, antimicrobial resistance or something as yet unidentified? Does he really want to continue treating climate change as a 'hoax' as severe weather decimates the homes of his supporters?\nOn migration, Trump's threat to deport millions of undocumented immigrants would cost billions, create labor shortages that fuel inflation and separate millions of US-citizen children from one or both parents. Yet with the need for an election issue behind him, he could negotiate long-awaited comprehensive legislation that would bolster border enforcement, fund the asylum system to reduce backlogs and introduce a statute of limitations that exempts longtime residents (who, despite his racist claims, typically have families, jobs and constructive lives in America) from the threat of deportation.\nI recognize this may all be wishful thinking. Trump may be too self-absorbed to think beyond the self-gratification of the moment. But if he has a shred of mental space left to worry about his legacy, that may be our best bet to salvage a potentially disastrous presidency \u2013 for America and the world.\nKenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch from 1993 to 2022, is a visiting professor at Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs",

Among today's 18-29 year olds, Ms. Harris had only a 4-point edge.\nThe numbers change, but the Trump working-class landslide included Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, unions, as well as the young \u2013 moving from Democrat Kamala to Republican Trump.\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\nThey all want economic growth, a closed border, and an America they can be proud of. Ruffini calls the new Trump coalition \"aspirational.\" I completely agree and, during this eleven-day Trump victory lap, he has managed to appoint 28 Cabinet and other senior positions to staff his administration.\nAs Newt Gingrich writes, this is the most reform-oriented Cabinet in history. Promises made, promises kept. Success is the best way to end the divisions and unify the country. A new golden age. You don't get a nationally joyous victory celebration like Mr. Trump 's \u2013 unless the country is truly rooting for you. That's the riff.\nThis article is adapted from Larry Kudlow's opening commentary on the Nov. 18, 2024, edition of \"Kudlow.\"",

        "excerpt": "Trump was originally believed to have two frontrunners in Howard Lutnick and Scott Bessent, but is now reported to be considering more options.",
        "summary": "Last week, Trump was said to be deciding between two leading candidates for Treasury Secretary.\nReports say Trump has been having second thoughts and is expanding his search to four major prospects.\nKevin Warsh and Marc Rowan have also been named as possible contenders.\nTwo weeks after securing his return to the White House, president-elect Donald Trump has swiftly been forming his Cabinet for 2025.\nTrump already announced six of the people he wants to lead the 15 executive departments, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for the Department of Health and Human Services and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for the State Department.\nHe appears to be taking a slower pace as he chooses his nominated successor to Janet Yellen, the current Secretary of the Treasury.\nThe new Treasury Secretary will likely have two immediate tasks: Helping the US avoid default when the national debt ceiling expires in January 2025 and extending the 2017 Trump tax cut, which is worth trillions and is mostly set to expire next year.\nThe president-elect was initially said to be considering just two candidates, but The Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported that he's been having second thoughts and expanded the list to four prospects.\nWith Trump seemingly still unsure over his choice, it's also possible that another candidate may emerge.\nHere are the top picks Trump is reportedly now considering for Secretary of the Treasury. A press contact for Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from BI.\nKevin Warsh\nWarsh, 54, is a former Morgan Stanley banker and one of the newer contenders.\nHe was an economic advisor to President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2006 and a governor of the Federal Reserve Board from 2006 to 2011. During the latter period, Warsh was a central figure in shaping the nation's response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis, working to rescue major ailing banks.\nMore recently, he's been working on Trump's transition team, helping with economic policy and personnel, according to The Journal.\nWarsh appears to have been in the president-elect's good graces for several years. Axios reported that Trump praised Warsh as a \"really handsome guy\" when the two met in 2017 at the White House.\nTrump had been floating Warsh that year as a frontrunner for Fed chair. He eventually picked Jerome Powell for the role.\nWarsh is often seen as a financial hawk, saying in October that he believed the Fed \"doesn't seem to have a serious theory of inflation\" and writing in July that it moved too slowly to curb surging prices.\nIn his July commentary, he blamed inflation on \"irresponsible government spending and excessive money printing.\" Warsh has also been critical of America's burgeoning debt.\nMarc Rowan\nRowan, 62, is a billionaire investor who leads Apollo Global Management, which he cofounded in the 1990s. It now has nearly $700 billion in assets under management. Apollo recently announced that it plans to double its assets under management to $1.5 trillion by 2029.\nThe Journal and the Times reported that Rowan, like Warsh, is one of Trump's new candidates.\nThe Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that while the billionaire's aides are in touch with Trump, Rowan isn't actively trying to secure the Treasury Secretary role and hasn't spoken to Trump personally about such a position.\nBut the Times also wrote that Trump has been telling his staff that he's impressed with Rowan, who Bloomberg estimates to be worth $10.9 billion.\nRowan has said that US economic concerns must be fixed by what he called \"wholesale change,\" which he said Trump and his new administration would bring.\nThat's broadly in line with how Trump has framed his Cabinet picks, as key movers who will upset the status quo and push fresh reform.\nRowan has kept a relatively low profile on his views about government policy, though he recently voiced concerns that the Fed could overstimulate the economy with interest rate cuts.\nHoward Lutnick\nLutnick, 63, is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a Wall Street financial services firm.\nLutnick has been serving as Trump's transition cochair with Linda McMahon, of WWE royalty. He's been a friend of the president-elect for decades, repeatedly holding fundraisers for Trump.\nIn August, Lutnick hosted an event at his home in the Hamptons that raised $15 million for the Trump-Vance campaign.\nLutnick has aligned himself closely with Trump's rhetoric. In late October, he expressed a vision for the US economy, describing America in the year 1900 to a crowd at Madison Square Garden, saying it was a time when the \"economy was rocking.\"\n\"We had no income tax, and all we had was tariffs,\" he said to a cheering stadium.\nLutnick has also said that under Trump, corporate taxes would be raised for US giants like Apple and Tesla. He said that Elon Musk, a Trump ally, welcomed such a move if it applied to all big players. Musk has endorsed Lutnick for Treasury Secretary.\nLutnick is also known for steering Cantor Fitzgerald after the 9/11 attack, which killed 658 of its 960 employees at the World Trade Center.\nScott Bessent\nBessent, 62, was one of the original frontrunners for Trump's Treasury Secretary.\nHis involvement emerged early last week when Reuters reported that the founder of macro investment firm Key Square Capital Management had been meeting with Trump at the Mar-a-Lago resort.\nBessent worked for the liberal philanthropist George Soros from 1991 to 2015, making a name for himself by betting big against the British pound, which collapsed in 1992, and then against the Japanese yen as it weakened in 2013.\nHe left Soros' firm in 2015 to start Key Square, and The Journal reported that he hasn't spoken to the billionaire in years.\nBessent has been vocal in his support for Trump, telling Breitbart in August that Vice President Kamala Harris would have crashed the economy if she was president.\nHe wrote an opinion column just after the election, praising Trump for a stock market rally after his win and knocking 23 Nobel Prize-winning economists for predicting that the president-elect's agenda would be \"counterproductive.\"\nThe investor laid out his ideas for the economy in his written piece, calling for the Trump administration to reduce government borrowing and to reform President Joe Biden's policies for investment in a \"quixotic energy transition.\"\nLike Lutnick, he's advocated for an economy that's more reliant on tariffs and weaned off income tax, saying the move would restore America's position on the world stage and help curb China's growth.\nHowever, The Journal reported that some conservatives in Trump's circle were concerned about Bessent's past experience working for Soros, who has attracted the ire of the MAGA base for his support of left-leaning causes.",

        "summary": "On a recent episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the comedian cum host delivered a strong response to a controversial social media post by Donald Trump Jr. towards Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump Jr. shared an image of Zelenskyy on his Instagram story and penned, 'POV: You are 38 days from losing your allowance,' implying that the U.S. aid to Ukraine might cease under the incoming Trump administration.\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 Donald Trump Jr. trolls President Zelensky by reposting a meme on his Instagram story that says:\n\"POV: You're 38 days away from losing your allowance.\" pic.twitter.com/FAHiPJFkRM\n\u2014 TabZ (@TabZLIVE) November 10, 2024\nJimmy Kimmel reacted sharply, stating, 'Bold words from a man who is definitely still on his father's phone plan.' He continued, 'If I was Donald Trump Jr., I wouldn't ever use the word 'allowance' in any situation. What is his job? Is being horrible an occupation now?' Kimmel also commended Zelenskyy for leading his country through \"the darkest times imaginable,\" as reported by HuffPost.\nJimmy Kimmel responded to Donald Trump Jr.'s Instagram post mocking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by saying, 'Those are bold words from a man who is definitely still on his father's phone plan.' pic.twitter.com/IMtwvpPVRt\n\u2014 Dupligate (@Dupligate) November 12, 2024\nKimmel also referenced a tweet from Zelenskyy, posted after the 2024 election results, in which the Ukrainian President congratulated Donald Trump on his victory. Zelenskyy expressed his admiration for Trump's campaign, jokingly praising his team and comparing their dedication to Ukrainian watermelons. Kimmel, in response, saluted Zelenskyy's willingness to sacrifice his dignity to secure his country's future.\n( @realDonaldTrump - Truth Social Post )\n( Donald J.

Trump \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 TRUTH POSTS (@TruthTrumpPosts) November 11, 2024\nKimmel then turned his attention to the President-elect, who recently posted on Truth Social, criticizing the NFL's new kickoff rule as 'ridiculous.' Kimmel quipped, 'I think this is a great waste of his time. I would much rather have him working on stuff like that\u2026Kickoffs, End Zone dances, those shorts cheerleaders wear now for no reason. That's what I want to see him up to.' He noted that the NFL implemented the rule to reduce brain injuries among players, and quipped, 'But Trump knows that without brain damage, he wouldn't be president of the United States right now.'\nKimmel has never shied away from mocking Trump Jr. In September, Kimmel targeted Trump Jr., linking him to J.D. Vance's controversial campaign. According to HuffPost, Kimmel noted that Trump Jr. influenced his father's decision to select Vance as a running mate and remarked, \"Another good move, dumbass.\" He further mocked, \"If Trump loses this election, he is gonna sue his son to drop the 'junior.'\"\nDon Jr. takes the stand in defense of the Trump crime family! pic.twitter.com/w7dxmrYUUR\n\u2014 Jimmy Kimmel Live (@JimmyKimmelLive) November 14, 2023\nSimilarly, in November 2023, Kimmel slammed Trump Jr. during his testimony in the Trump Organization's civil fraud trial. Trump Jr., who was the executive vice president of the organization, launched the legal proceedings, primarily shifting the blame onto the family's accountants. According to the Daily Beast, he referred to him as 'the fraudigal son' and shared a clip of Trump Jr. awkwardly joking that he 'should have worn makeup' before the proceedings. Kimmel added, 'What he lacks in intelligence, he also lacks in charisma,' as part of his broader critique of Trump Jr.'s demeanor during the trial.",

        "summary": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 The pressure is mounting for Gov. Ron DeSantis to appoint Lara Trump to fill the U.S. Senate vacancy left by Marco Rubio, who was tapped to serve as President-elect Donald Trump's Secretary of State.\nBut DeSantis, freshly returned from a weeklong trade mission to Italy, said he is weeks away from making a choice, even as influential MAGA supporters push the president-elect's daughter-in-law for the position.\nSeveral candidates have already made their interest known and several others are expected to be considered, too, DeSantis said.\n'More extensive vetting and candidate interviews will be conducted over the next few weeks, with a selection likely made by the beginning of January,' DeSantis said in a message posted on X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk.\nDeSantis said Florida deserves a senator who will help Trump carry out his agenda to strengthen immigration and border security, 'take on the entrenched bureaucracy and administrative state,' and improve the economy.\nThe candidate should be 'animated by conservative principles' and have a proven track record, DeSantis said.\n'I have not been asked yet, but I certainly would strongly consider it if it's presented to me,' Lara Trump told Fox commentator Maria Bartiromo Thursday. She said she had not heard from DeSantis, however.\nTrump nominated Rubio, a U.S. Senator from Miami since 2011, to head up the Department of State. DeSantis must appoint a replacement who will serve until a special election is held in 2026.\nRubio would begin his new job on Jan. 20, after Trump is sworn in and his administration officially begins. As head of the State Department, Rubio would oversee foreign relations policy.\nThose closest to DeSantis have said he would most likely pick someone to serve out the next two years to be a placeholder, rather than a strong contender who would run for the seat in 2026. James Uthmeier, the governor's chief of staff, was mentioned by insiders as DeSantis' first choice, followed by Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez and Attorney General Ashley Moody.\nBut MAGA supporters began lobbying hard on social media for Lara Trump, a former television producer and the spouse of Eric Trump, son of the president-elect. They have lived in Jupiter since 2021.\nNot only has she been endorsed by Musk, but Florida Sen. Rick Scott, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna and brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr. also said she'd be a good pick.\nSen. Joe Gruters, former chair of the Republican Party of Florida, said 'the fact that Lara Trump went on live TV to make an ask' should be a pretty clear sign to DeSantis that Trump wants her selected.\n'Lara has proven herself,' Gruters said. As co-chair of the Republican National Committee, she helped elect her father-in-law and helped flip many congressional seats red, he said.\nTapping Lara Trump could solidify DeSantis' relationship with Trump, which has been strained for years, ever since a falling out between DeSantis and Trump campaign manager Susie Wiles after she helped him win his first term as governor in 2018. The divide between the two politicians grew when DeSantis challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination last year but has been on the mend since DeSantis dropped out after the Iowa caucuses and endorsed Trump for president.\nThose close to DeSantis said the relationship is much better. The two had a sit down in April brokered by real estate mogul Steve Witkoff, Trump's pick for special envoy in the Middle East. DeSantis also played golf with Trump at his Bedminster club in New Jersey and speaks on the phone with him occasionally, sources inside the DeSantis circle said.\n'This is about doing the right thing and there is nobody better than his daughter-in-law,' Gruters said.",

        "excerpt": "Donald Trump is shaking up Washington and his second administration, after lamenting the people in his first Cabinet in 2016.",
        "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump 's unconventional selections for his second White House term have shocked Washington and bucked the traditional GOP establishment.\nBut that team of disruptors may be exactly what Trump wants after voters soundly rejected Vice President Kamala Harris and ushered in Republican total control of the White House, Senate, and House.\nUnlike his 2016 win, Trump will return to the White House with Day One experience of how Washington operates and a clearer understanding of the staff who dare to undo the status quo. He also knows who will be loyal to him, as evidenced by those who stood by him when he was in the political wilderness after the Jan. 6. 2021 attack on the Capitol.\nPerhaps most emblematic of Trump's new approach is nominating former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz as his attorney general. Picking the firebrand loyalist sent shockwaves through Washington with some congressional lawmakers calling the selection ' reckless.'\n'He's a disruptor, and the Department of Justice needs massive disruption,' said House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN). 'And you know, he would, he would shake things up over (the) Department of Justice in a way that need(s) to be shaken up.'\nPete Hegseth to serve as his secretary of defense, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services Secretary, and ex-Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence has also left some experts in the health, defense, and intelligence industries incredulous.\nHowever, Trump's past comments indicate the candidates and the shake-ups they may cause is a major reason why Trump wanted them.\nPrior to the November election, Trump told popular podcast host Joe Rogan that the 'biggest mistake' of his first administration was the people he surrounded himself with.\n'I picked a few people I shouldn't have picked,' Trump told Rogan. 'Neocons or bad people or disloyal people.'\nIt was a rare admission from the former president that he shouldn't have listened to more experienced politicos when he was staffing up his first White House.\nFor his second administration, Trump publicly stated that some well-known establishment figures wouldn't be invited back.\n'I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country.'\nHe also took to Truth Social to throw cold water on another by-the-book leader. 'I respect Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, greatly, but he will not be invited to be a part of the Trump Administration,' Trump wrote on Thursday.\nInstead, Trump is elevating billionaire tech Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy as the co-heads ' Department of Government Efficiency,' despite neither leader having served in political office.\nMusk's elevation comes as a reward after he spent millions of his fortune bankrolling America PAC helping turnout voters in swing states and Ramaswamy served as a key surrogate after bowing out of the GOP presidential primary.\n'The common denominator across these picks is that of a loyal disruptor. It isn't just being a supporter of Trump, it's being trusted to actually not work against Trump and to actually drain the swamp,' said Dennis Lennox, a Republican strategist.\nGabbard, for example, is a former Democrat who disavowed her party to endorse Trump and then later joined the GOP. For her loyalty, Trump tapped her with a plum position to oversee 18 agencies comprising the Intelligence community.\n'Someone like a Tulsi Gabbard needs Trump a lot more than he needs her. Had Trump (not) elevated her, she would be roaming the political wilderness as a politically homeless, washed-up ex-congressman and unsuccessful presidential candidate,' said Lennox.\nWayne King, president of Old North Strategies, pointed to the American public's hunger for a transformative leader as why Trump needed to select iconoclastic nominees.\n'With the election of Donald Trump, with the increase in the Senate and the House, a trifecta government ran by Republicans, obviously, the American people want everything to change,' said King, who is also a former chief of staff to former North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows. 'And Donald Trump is wholesale change, and I think that is very clear the mandate that he has to do.'\nTrump himself indirectly alluded to this itch for change During an America First Policy Institute gala at Mar-a-Lago Thursday night.\n'The American people have just delivered really something very amazing, the biggest political victory in 129 years,' Trump said about his defeat of Harris. 'So we swept all swing states, we won the popular vote \u2014 oh, I love that.'\nThe president-elect spent months on the campaign trail claiming that if he wasn't reelected the nation would collapse into complete dysfunction. But now with a resounding victory, Trump is embracing a mandate to enact drastic change after four years under President Joe Biden.\nGaetz has been a longtime ally to Trump, defending him in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and has echoed Trump's claims of a 'deep state' targeting him.\n'We ought to have a full court press against this WEAPONIZED government that has been turned against our people,' Gaetz wrote on X before deleting the post mere hours before his nomination as attorney general was announced. 'And if that means ABOLISHING every one of the three letter agencies, from the FBI to the ATF, I'm ready to get going!'\nTrump very likely enjoys Gaetz's combative relationships on Capitol Hill, where the firebrand lawmaker led the charge to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\nEven Kennedy's less conventional health beliefs were likely a boon to Trump tapping him to lead HHS after the COVID-19 pandemic helped since his 2020 presidential run. Kennedy's decision to suspend his campaign, endorse Trump, fight to remove his name from swing state ballots, and then campaign with Trump also boosted his credentials in Trump's eyes.\nYet some experts and lawmakers have expressed concern about choosing loyalty over experience.\n'Anytime an incoming administration chooses based on something other than the ability to do the job, it's potentially a risky decision,' said Heath Brown, an associate professor at John Jay College. 'Loyalty is also, in Washington, very short-lived. So choosing based on loyalty can also be risky because someone who's been loyal in the past isn't always loyal in the future.'\nTrump, the former reality TV star, has gravitated to those who are media savvy, and with physical attributes, to captivate television audiences while defending Trump's vision for the nation. Hegseth, Gabbard, Gaetz, along with Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL), Trump's pick for as his national security adviser, and CIA Director nominee John Ratcliffe all have been fixtures on Fox News.\nGov. Kristi Noem (R-SD) changed her looks before being tapped as Trump's secretary of homeland security. The South Dakota governor revamped her outfit, wardrobe, and even her teeth as she built her alliance with Trump.\n'There's a lot of things that senior Cabinet officials do,' Brown, the author of Roadblocked: Joe Biden's Rocky Transition to the Presidency, cautioned. 'Going on TV is one very small part of what they do and maybe the least important part.'\nKing, the former chief of staff, praised some of Trump's Cabinet picks as 'great communicators' but he also stressed they were also change agents.\n'They know that government has to change, and the American people not only mandated, they are demanding that if you look at the election results,' he said. 'And the only way to get change is to have people come in that are change agents, that believe that the federal government is broken and it has to be repaired. And that's exactly what I believe that Donald Trump is sending the message loud and clear that he's willing to do that.'",

        "excerpt": "Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski explain why they visited President elect Donald Trump.",
        "summary": "'Morning Joe' hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski visited President-elect Donald Trump and members of his team at Mar-a-Lago last Friday, where the frequent Trump critics said they agreed to 'restart communications.' The MSNBC pair told viewers about the surprising visit on Monday morning, emphasizing that the trip was meant as way to possibly re-ignite a dialogue between the show and network and the incoming Trump administration.\n'We didn't see eye-to-eye on a lot of issues, and we told him so,' Scarborough told MSNBC viewers Monday morning. Specially, he pointed to issues like abortion rights, mass deportation and Trump's comments that he will seek retribution against his political opponents as well as members of the media.\n'What we did agree on was to restart communications,' Brzezinski said. She used her father, diplomat and political scientist Zbigniew Brzezinski, as an example, noting that he often spoke with world leaders he 'profoundly disagreed' with. 'That's a task shared with reporters and commentators alike.'\nJoe and Mika went to Mar a Lago to talk with Trump over the weekend. First face-to-face meeting in seven years. \"We didn't see eye-to-eye on a lot of issues and we told him so,\" @JoeNBC says. \"What we did agree on \u2013 was to restart communications,\" @morningmika says. pic.twitter.com/lyWZWK4CwX \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) November 18, 2024\nHere's part two of @Morning_Joe's prepared remarks about the Trump meeting. \"Don't be mistaken. We are not here to defend or normalize Donald Trump,\" @JoeNBC says. \"We are here to report on him\" and provide insights in \"these deeply unsettling times.\" pic.twitter.com/DTplzTSKhs \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) November 18, 2024\nThe visit marked the first time the duo have seen Trump in person in seven years. The last time the pair spoke to Trump was in March of 2020, save for a personal call Scarborough made to the politician the morning after an assassination attempt was made on his life in Pennsylvania. This move was especially notable as both Scarborough and Brzezinski have been vocal critics of Trump.\nBrzezinski said that Trump was 'cheerful, upbeat and interested in finding common ground' with Democrats during the meeting. Scarborough also revealed that a member of Trump's team said that, because Trump will be a President who will not be seeking re-election, 'now may be the time for both parties to get to work.' Brzezinski also pointed to Trump's win of the electoral and popular vote despite the Jan. 6 insurrection and his many trials as the reason why they orchestrated this meeting in the first place.\n'Joe and I realized it's time to do something different and that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump but also talking with him,' Brzezinski summarized.

        "excerpt": "Elon Musk's meddling over Donald Trump's treasury secretary pick may be hurting his reputation in the president-elect's orbit.",
        "summary": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk risks alienating himself from the president-elect after the battle over who will become Donald Trump 's treasury secretary spilled out into the public.\nMusk, along with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., took to social media this weekend to make a last-minute bid for Howard Lutnick, the billionaire CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald who co-led Trump's transition team, as the next enforcer of Trump's economic vision.\n'My view fwiw is that Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change,' Musk wrote on X, the company he owns, to push Trump not to select investor and hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as treasury secretary.\nBessent, unlike Lutnick, is viewed as the more traditional, establishment-minded nominee, which appears off-putting to Trump supporters, who want more change agents in the second administration. He is viewed more closely to Steven Mnuchin, who served as treasury secretary under Trump's first term.\nWould be interesting to hear more people weigh in on this for @realDonaldTrump to consider feedback.\nMy view fwiw is that Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change.\nBusiness-as-usual is driving America bankrupt, so we need change\u2026 https://t.co/igGLZOJ8wz\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 16, 2024\nKennedy claimed that Lutnick's support of bitcoin, which Trump has supported, made him the better pick for treasury secretary.\n'Bitcoin is the currency of freedom, a hedge against inflation for middle class Americans, a remedy against the dollar's downgrade from the world's reserve currency, and the offramp from a ruinous national debt,' he wrote. 'Bitcoin will have no stronger advocate than Howard Lutnik.'\nBitcoin is the currency of freedom , a hedge against inflation for middle class Americans,a remedy against the dollar's downgrade from the world's reserve currency, and the offramp from a ruinous national debt. Bitcoin will have no stronger advocate than Howard Lutnik.\n\u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) November 16, 2024\nThe public pressure for Trump to select Lutnick appears to be backfiring after the president-elect had been announcing administration nominees with overwhelming speed.\nTrump is now reportedly eyeing Marc Rowan, CEO of Apollo Global Management, Robert Lighthizer, Trump's trade policy adviser, and Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve governor, as possible picks.\n'Trump cannot be bullied and won't be bullied,' a Republican consultant who requested anonymity to speak freely said. 'And it seems clear to me that Musk, specifically, and perhaps Kennedy, to some extent, are grossly overplaying their hands here.'\nMusk has remained closely at Trump's side and at Mar-a-Lago in the run-up and aftermath of the election. His super PAC spent more than $100 million to boost Trump's campaign ground game and even hosted a $1 million daily giveaway. Trump rewarded him by appointing him to lead the Department of Government Efficiency with Vivek Ramaswamy.\n'Elon contributed more to support Trump's election and did more to help Trump win than anyone. Period, it's not even close,' a second Republican strategist said. 'So, I think he's earned the right to \u2026 not only have opinions but to share them. Ultimately, it's Trump's decision what he wants to do.'\nTrump, at first, teased Musk against outshining him. He praised Musk as 'a new star' before later quipping to the House GOP Conference last week that 'Elon won't go home,' referring to Musk's prolonged presence in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n'I can't get rid of him. Until I don't like him,' Trump added.\nThe billionaire mogul's presence at Mar-a-Lago gave off the impression he was a shadow president. He joined a Trump phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and met privately with Iran's United Nations ambassador. Musk has also participated in interviewing for nearly every job in Trump's transition, according to the New York Times.\nBut Musk's public advocacy for administration nominees could risk offending Trump's inner circle.\nThe tech billionaire attempted to muscle Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) as incoming Senate majority leader last week. But the pressure was unsuccessful as Scott failed to advance past the first round of voting and lost out to Sen. John Thune (R-SD).\nThe failure to convince GOP senators to make Scott their next leader is unsurprising, given the establishment acumen that Thune and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), his top challenger, built up over years as they battled to replace outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n'Scott was never a plausible majority leader,' the second strategist said, citing a lack of viability to 27 votes from GOP senators. 'I think Elon was probably doing that more to apply pressure than anything else. I don't think he probably believed Scott was going to win.'\nHowever, the treasury secretary could prove more consequential as Trump and his aides are reportedly displeased with the public fighting. Lutnick, according to the New York Times, may have hurt his chances.\n'Trump has privately expressed frustration that Mr. Lutnick has been hanging around him too much and that he has been manipulating the transition process for his own ends,' the paper reported.\nUnder the guidance of incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles, Trump's transition has little appetite for the backbiting that defined his first term. Axios reported Musk and Boris Epshteyn, a key Trump adviser, got into a 'massive blowup' at Mar-a-Lago after Musk accused Epshteyn of leaking transition nominees to the media.\nWhoever is selected would have prime leadership in revamping the 2025 tax cut legislation as the 2017 bill expires, and with Musk co-leading an effort to slash government waste, he likely wants a key partner as treasury secretary to help with cutting federal government spending.\nA third GOP strategist, with insight into the Trump campaign's thinking, told the Washington Examiner that the treasury position is taking on more of an outsize importance due to the economy's role in Trump winning reelection.\nThe renegotiating of the tax legislation will be crucial to Trump's second-term legacy, as the GOP will control both Congress and the White House.\n'That is the one thing that they do have the votes on, but they want to make sure they get the right people in place to make sure that they can get this up the hill,' the strategist said.\nLutnick has publicly supported Trump's embrace of tariffs and called for trimming government spending in a bid for more efficiency.\nYet Trump sees himself as the key decider of his administration and does not take lightly to being undermined.\n'Despite Elon Musk being the world's richest man and that being something that Trump respects enormously, they are still not equals in Donald Trump's mind,' the first Republican consultant said. 'Donald Trump is the one who was elected president, not Elon Musk. And if Musk wants to continue to have a place at Trump's court, he best learn his place sooner rather than later. Or he will be cast aside, like many, many others.'\nYet the second GOP strategist claimed the Musk situation is simply the cost of doing business.\n'Behind closed doors, there's always jockeying in presidential transitions, and you've always got people wanting, maybe their person, or an ally of theirs, to take certain jobs versus others,' the third strategist said. 'I don't see this as any different. It's not like Elon is the only one lobbying for people.'\nThe Trump campaign did not disparage Musk when asked for comment and instead praised his attributes in a statement to the Washington Examiner.\n'As President Trump has said, Elon Musk is a genius, an innovator, and has literally made history by building creative, modern, and efficient systems,' said Brian Hughes, a Trump spokesman. 'Elon Musk has dedicated himself to America's future by offering to serve with President Trump to ensure our government works more efficiently and uses America's taxpayer dollars effectively.'",

        "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has made a flurry of picks for his cabinet and other high-ranking administration positions following his election victory.\nHere are the early picks and top contenders for some of the key posts overseeing defense, intelligence, health, diplomacy, trade, immigration and economic policymaking.\nMARCO RUBIO, secretary of state\nTrump tapped U.S. Senator Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state, putting the Florida-born politician on track to be the first Latino to serve as the United States' top diplomat.\nRubio, 53, was arguably the most hawkish option on Trump's shortlist for secretary of state. The senator has in past years advocated for a muscular foreign policy with respect to U.S. geopolitical foes, including China, Iran and Cuba.\nOver the last several years he has softened some of his stances to align more closely with Trump's views. The president-elect accuses past U.S. presidents of leading the U.S. into costly and futile wars and has pushed for a less interventionist foreign policy.\nMATT GAETZ, attorney general\nTrump said that he had selected Gaetz, a U.S. representative, to be his nominee for attorney general.\n\"Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System,\" Trump said in a statement announcing the selection of the Florida lawmaker.\nTrump's inner circle has described the attorney general as the most important member of the administration after Trump himself, key to his plans to carry out mass deportations, pardon Jan. 6 rioters and seek retribution against those who prosecuted him over the past four years.\nTULSI GABBARD, director of national intelligence Trump named Gabbard, a former Democratic representative and critic of the Biden administration, as his director of national intelligence.\nGabbard left the Democratic Party in 2022 to become an independent and has little direct experience with intelligence work. If confirmed, she would become the top official in the U.S. intelligence community after Trump starts his second term in January.\nROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., health and human services secretary Kennedy is an environmental activist who has spread misinformation about the dangers of vaccines. He has suggested he would gut the 18,000-employee Food and Drug Administration, which ensures the safety of food, drugs and medical devices, and replace hundreds of employees at the National Institutes of Health.\nKennedy ran for president in this year's election, first as a Democrat and then as an independent, before dropping out in August in exchange for a role in Trump's administration.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services oversees the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the massive Medicare and Medicaid Services programs, which provide health coverage for the poor, those aged 65 and older, and the disabled.\nPETE HEGSETH, defense secretary\nTrump said he had picked Hegseth as his secretary of defense. Hegseth is a Fox News commentator and veteran who has expressed disdain for the so-called \"woke\" policies of Pentagon leaders, including its top military officer.\nHegseth, if confirmed by the Senate, could make good on Trump's campaign promises to rid the U.S. military of generals who he accuses of pursuing progressive policies on diversity in the ranks that conservatives have rallied against.\nIt could also set up a collision course between Hegseth and the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General C.Q.\nBrown, who Hegseth accused of \"pursuing the radical positions of left-wing politicians.\"\nLEE ZELDIN, EPA administrator\nTrump announced he had appointed Zeldin, a former congressman from New York state, as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\nZeldin, 44, a staunch Trump ally, served in Congress from 2015 to 2023. In 2022, he lost the New York governor's race to Democratic incumbent Kathy Hochul. Trump has promised to overhaul U.S. energy policy, with the aim of maximizing the country's already record-high oil and gas production by rolling back regulations and speeding up permitting.\nMIKE WALTZ, national security adviser\nTrump said he had picked Waltz, a Republican U.S. representative, to be national security adviser. Waltz is a retired Army Green Beret who has been a leading critic of China.\nWaltz, a 50-year-old Trump loyalist who also served in the National Guard as a colonel, has criticised Chinese activity in the Asia-Pacific and has voiced the need for the U.S. to be ready for a potential conflict in the region.\nThe national security adviser is a powerful role, which does not require Senate confirmation. Waltz will be responsible for briefing Trump on key national security issues and coordinating with different agencies.\nWhile slamming the Biden administration for a disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Waltz has publicly praised Trump's foreign policy views.\nTrump announced that Wiles, one of his two campaign managers, will be his White House chief of staff.\nWhile the specifics of her political views are somewhat unclear, Wiles, 67, is credited with running a successful and efficient campaign. Supporters hope she will instill a sense of order and discipline that was often lacking during Trump's first four-year term, when he cycled through a number of chiefs of staff.\nTOM HOMAN, 'border czar'\nTrump said that Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump's first administration, will be in charge of the country's borders.\nTrump made cracking down on people in the country illegally a central element of his campaign, promising mass deportations.\nHoman, 62, said on Monday he would prioritize deporting immigrants illegally in the U.S. who posed safety and security threats as well as those working at job sites.\nTrump announced that Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman and staunch Trump supporter, would be his ambassador to the United Nations.\nStefanik, 40, a U.S. representative from New York state and House Republican conference chair, took a leadership position in the House of Representatives in 2021 when she was elected to replace then-Representative Liz Cheney, who was ousted for criticizing Trump's false claims of election fraud.\nStefanik will arrive at the U.N. after bold promises by Trump to end the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel's war in Gaza.\nELON MUSK AND VIVEK RAMASWAMY, heads of Department of Government Efficiency\nTrump named tech billionaire Musk and Ramaswamy, a former Republican presidential candidate, to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency, rewarding two of his well-known supporters from the private sector.\nTrump said that Musk and Ramaswamy will reduce government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut waste and restructure federal agencies. Trump said the new department would bring in external expertise and work with the White House and Office of Management and Budget.\nKRISTI NOEM, homeland security secretary\nNoem, the governor of South Dakota, has been picked to serve as the next homeland security secretary, Trump said.\nNoem, 52, once seen as a possible running mate for Trump, is currently serving her second four-year term as South Dakota's governor. She rose to national prominence after refusing to impose a statewide mask mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Department of Homeland Security is responsible for everything from border protection and immigration to disaster response and the U.S. Secret Service.\nDOUG BURGUM, interior secretary and 'energy czar' Trump has chosen Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to be interior secretary.\nBurgum, 68, a wealthy former software company executive, has portrayed himself as a traditional, business-minded conservative. He ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination before quitting and becoming a loyal Trump supporter.\nThe Interior Department manages public lands and minerals, national parks and wildlife refuges. The department also carries out the U.S. government's trust responsibility to Native Americans. In the energy czar role, he is expected to coordinate with several agencies to boost oil and gas output.\nJOHN RATCLIFFE, CIA director\nTrump said he had picked Ratcliffe, the former director of national intelligence, to serve as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in his second administration.\nA former congressman and prosecutor who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's last year in office, Ratcliffe, 59, is seen as a hardcore Trump loyalist who could likely win Senate confirmation. Still, during his time as director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe often contradicted the assessments of career civil servants, drawing criticism from Democrats who said he politicized the role.\nKEVIN WARSH, potential treasury secretary Trump is considering Warsh, 54, a former investment banker who served on the Federal Reserve Board, for treasury secretary according to news reports. He is seen as a fiscal hawk and proponent of higher savings rates.\nMARC ROWAN, potential treasury secretary Trump is considering Rowan, 62, who co-founded Apollo Global Management and became the firm's CEO in 2021, for treasury secretary, according to news reports.\nBILL HAGERTY, potential treasury secretary Republican U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, is also in the running for treasury secretary, according to the Wall Street Journal. Trump met the 65-year-old at Mar-a-Lago last week.\nSCOTT BESSENT, potential treasury secretary Bessent, a key economic adviser to Trump, is seen as a candidate for treasury secretary. A longtime hedge fund investor who taught at Yale University for several years, Bessent has a warm relationship with the president-elect.\nWhile Bessent has long favored the laissez-faire policies that were popular in the pre-Trump Republican Party, he has also spoken highly of Trump's use of tariffs as a negotiating tool.\nHe has praised the president-elect's economic philosophy, which rests on a skepticism of both regulations and international trade.\nROBERT LIGHTHIZER, potential trade czar or treasury secretary\nA loyalist who served as Trump's U.S. trade representative for essentially the then-president's entire term, Lighthizer will almost certainly be invited back.\nThough Bessent likely has a better shot at becoming treasury secretary, Lighthizer has an outside chance, and he might be able to reprise his old role if he's interested.\nThe Wall Street Journal has reported Trump wanted Lighthizer as his trade czar.\nLike Trump, Lighthizer, 77, is a trade skeptic and a firm believer in tariffs. He was one of the leading figures in Trump's trade war with China and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, with Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term.\nHOWARD LUTNICK, potential treasury secretary The co-chair of Trump's transition effort and the longtime chief executive of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick is in the running for treasury secretary.\nA bombastic New Yorker like Trump, Lutnick, 63, has uniformly praised the president-elect's economic policies, including his use of tariffs.\nHe has at times given elaborate, unvarnished opinions about what policies will be enacted in Trump's second term. Some Trump allies complained privately that he too often presented himself as speaking on behalf of the campaign.\nLINDA McMAHON, potential commerce secretary McMahon, a professional wrestling magnate and former Small Business Administration director, is seen as the frontrunner to lead Trump's Department of Commerce, three sources briefed on the plans said.\nMcMahon, 76, is a major donor and was an early supporter of the Republican president-elect when he first ran for the White House almost a decade ago. This time, Trump tapped her to co-lead a transition team formed to help vet personnel and draft policy ahead of the Nov. 5 election.\nMcMahon is the co-founder and former CEO of the professional wrestling franchise WWE. She later served as director of the Small Business Administration, resigning in 2019, and went on to lead a pro-Trump political action committee that supported his 2020 reelection bid.\nKASH PATEL, potential candidate for national security posts A former Republican House staffer who served in various high-ranking staff roles in the defense and intelligence communities during Trump's first term, Patel frequently appeared on the campaign trail to rally support for the candidate.\nAny position requiring Senate confirmation may be a challenge, however.\nPatel, 44, has leaned into controversy throughout his career. In an interview with Trump ally Steve Bannon last year, he promised to \"come after\" politicians and journalists perceived to be enemies of Trump.\nDuring Trump's first term, Patel, seen as the ultimate Trump loyalist, drew animosity from some more experienced national security officials, who saw him as volatile and too eager to please the then-president.

        "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has made two more selections for his Cabinet: Fox Business host and fellow former reality TV star Sean Duffy for Secretary of Transportation and Brendan Carr to head the Federal Communications Commission.\nDuffy, selected on Monday, is a co-host of \"The Bottom Line\" on Fox Business and was a Trump loyalist in Congress during Trump's first term. Carr, chosen on Sunday, is a senior Republican on the commission most recently known for criticizing \"Saturday Night Live\" for an appearance by Vice President Kamala Harris, saying it was a violation of the \"equal time\" rule governing candidate appearances on television.\nMeanwhile peril continued to mount Monday for Trump's pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz. Florida lawyer Joel Leppard, who represented two women in the House Ethics Committee investigation into the former representative, said the women alleged Gaetz paid them for sex, according to multiple media reports.\nOne of the women also said she saw Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old, according to reports from the Washington Post and ABC News.\nThe Justice Department's investigation into sex trafficking allegations against Gaetz ended without charges. Gaetz, who has denied wrongdoing, resigned from Congress Wednesday, two days before a House Ethics Committee report about the probe was scheduled for release.\nA spokesperson for Gaetz's House office, Jacob Bliss, directed USA TODAY to a statement from Trump transition spokesperson Alex Pfeiffer, who described the allegations as a \"baseless\" attempt to derail Trump's upcoming administration.\nHere's the latest on Trump's latest choices.\nDepartment of Transportation pick former 'Real World' contestant\nDuffy's nomination marks the second Fox connection among those who have been chosen for nomination to the incoming administration.\nPete Hegseth, a former Fox News host, was chosen to be Trump's Secretary of Defense. Hegseth is currently embroiled in sexual assault and far-right extremism scandals involving his tattoos. Hegseth has denied the sexual assault claims and said he only reached a settlement agreement with the accuser to protect his job in 2020.

        "summary": "Donald Trump's quirky dance moves on the campaign trail have become the latest celebration craze in sports.\nNFL stars, UFC great Jon 'Bones' Jones, and college football players have recently danced like Trump, turning their highlight plays into viral moments.\nLas Vegas Raiders rookie sensation Brock Bowers was the latest to celebrated his touchdown score Sunday with a Trump dance in a 34-19 loss to the Miami Dolphins as his postgame media availability ended.\n\"I've seen everyone do it,\" Bowers told USA TODAY Sports, answering the last question of his postgame media availability. \"I watched the UFC fight [Saturday] night and Jon Jones did it. I like watching UFC so I saw it, and thought it was cool.\"\nAlong with Bowers, Detroit Lions defenders Za'Darius Smith and Malcolm Rodriguez celebrated a stop, while Tennessee Titans players Calvin Ridley and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine prematurely celebrated a touchdown Sunday.\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\nIt's a simple routine: Bend your elbows, close your fists, and move your arms back and forth as the Trump vibes flow. Add head-tiling and facial expressions for some flair.\nTrump often performed the stiff boogie down that stole the show during campaign rallies across the country en route to winning the 2024 presidential election over Vice President Kamala Harris.\nNow, a silly dance has become the latest intersection between sports and politics.\nTrump was sitting ringside and appeared amused as Jones playfully gestured his iteration of the Trump dance twice at UFC 309 in Madison Square Garden.\n'I'm proud to be a great American champion. I'm proud to be a Christian American champion,' Jones said in his post-fight interview.\nThis latest Trump foray into sports is a far cry from just seven years ago when Trump accused NFL players of disrespecting the American flag by kneeling during the National Anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice.\nNow, NFL athletes are being reposted and shared on the social media accounts of the 45th and 47th president.\nSan Francisco 49ers edge rusher Nick Bosa started the Trump dance trend in the NFL during his Nov. 10 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, celebrating a sack with teammates Leonard Floyd, Sam Okuayinonu and Fred Warner.\nBosa's dance earned him a shoutout from Trump on social media network Truth Social.\n'I think you know the answer to that question,' Bosa told the San Francisco Chronicle last week when asked his inspiration for the Trump dance. 'All the guys wanted me to do it. I wasn't even going to do it, but the boys reminded me. And it was fun.'\nWest Virginia's Nicco Marchiol also had his Trump dance posted by Trump on social media on Nov. 12.\nDrake University's Trey Radocha, Northern Illinois University's Tristen Tewes and University of Texas defender Michael Taaffee have also celebrated with Trump dances during games. East Carolina quarterback Katin Houser may have started the trend in college with his celebration two days after the Nov. 5 election.\nIt's no surprise the Trump dance has become viral. As much as the 78-year-old Trump has been divisive when it comes to politics, he's been ingrained in pop culture for much of his life.\nThe Trump dance is challenging the political idea of athletes not 'sticking to sports' with a silly dance that's seems to be sticking around.",

        "excerpt": "Trump's hunt for a Treasury Secretary has reportedly become a bit of a mess. Several new names have reportedly entered the conversation.",
        "summary": "While Donald Trump was quick to name several nominees for Cabinet positions, one of the most watched posts, Treasury Secretary, is still a question mark. And the search for who will lead the country's fiscal policy seems to be getting a lot more complicated.\nSome candidates have dropped out. Others are jockeying for position with Trump. New names are being floated. And Elon Musk has inserted himself into the process as well, though not everyone on Team Trump is reportedly happy about that.\nThis added turbulence comes as Trump is already facing potential resistance even among his own party to at least two of his choices: former congressman Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) for Attorney General and Fox News host Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary. Here's where things stand.\nWho are considered the leading candidates for Treasury Secretary?\nAt the end of last week, it seemed almost certain that either Howard Lutnick, the CEO of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald and a co-leader of the Trump transition team, or Scott Bessent, a former Soros Fund Management executive and founder and CEO of Key Square Group, would get the job.\nBoth are still serious contenders, but according to multiple reports in-fighting for the position has reportedly annoyed Trump to the point that he is now considering other candidates as well.\nWho else is Trump considering for Treasury Secretary?\nA few new names have entered the conversation. The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump is now also looking at Kevin Warsh, former economic-policy adviser to President George W. Bush and a one-time member of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, and Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan.\nWarsh had been previously floated as a candidate to become chairman of the Fed after Jerome Powell departs the role, whether that's when his term ends in May 2026 or if Trump will attempt to fire him. Warsh was on the short list for Fed Chair in 2019, when Trump ended up picking Powell.\nRowan, meanwhile, has been critical of the Fed, questioning why it was cutting rates, given the health of the economy. He has an estimated net worth of over $8 billion and has been a supporter of Musk's role at the Department of Government Efficiency.\nAdditionally, Bill Hagerty could be under consideration and reportedly met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago several days ago. Haggarty is a former ambassador to Japan under the first Trump administration, and has been a Senator from Tennessee since 2021. He has firmly opposed financial support for Ukraine. He's also well liked in the party, which could make his confirmation a very quick process. He sits on several influential Senate subcommittees, including banking and foreign relations. And Politico said Trump's longtime trade policy adviser Robert Lighthizer could be considered for the job as well.\nWhy is this pick taking so long?\nThere has been a lot of behind-the-scenes jockeying for this post, which has become annoying to Trump, according to reports. Trump has privately expressed frustration that Lutnick 'has been hanging around him too much and that he has been manipulating the transition process for his own ends,' according to The New York Times.\nWho has backed out of consideration for Treasury Secretary?\nBefore the most recent drama, several candidates for Treasury Secretary took their names out of consideration. John Paulson of the investment firm Paulson & Co. backed out six days ago, saying, 'My complex financial obligations would prevent me from holding an official position in President Trump's administration at this time.' Larry Kudlow of Fox Business was considered an outside shot, but told the Trump team last Friday he would not be returning to government work. And while he was never an official candidate, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon made it clear he had little interest in a role. Trump, last week, said Dimon would not be a part of his Cabinet.\nHow has Elon Musk become involved in the search for a Treasury Secretary?\nMusk, on Saturday, issued an endorsement on X.com for Lutnick to get the job, saying 'Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change. Business-as-usual is driving America bankrupt, so we need change one way or another.' He also encouraged his 205 million followers to 'weigh in' on the matter, tagging Trump in the post.\nThat post reportedly annoyed some on Trump's team, with one advisor telling the Washington Post Musk was acting as a 'co-president' and could be overstepping his role of advisor. There has been, however, no evidence that Trump and Musk's relationship has been strained so far. The two attended a UFC fight Saturday, then posed on Trump's plane (along with Don Jr. and Robert Kennedy Jr.) over a meal of McDonald's burgers and fries.\nWhat happens now?\nTrump will reportedly continue to meet with potential Treasury Secretaries this week. Some possible candidates, like Hagerty, met with him last week. Lutnick and Bessent have already met with Trump.\nThe transition team has not given any timeline for the Treasury Secretary announcement. Originally, watchers had expect Trump to name someone at the end of last week.",

        "summary": "Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley hosts a campaign event in Houston, Texas, U.S. March 4, 2024.\nNikki Haley claimed that Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski had an ulterior motive in re-establishing communication with Donald Trump, suggesting the co-hosts made nice with the president-elect for the sake of their ratings.\nThe Morning Joe stars met with the president elect on Friday at Mar-a-Lago where they discussed 'a lot of issues.' Scarborough and Brzezinski announced to the show's audience on Monday they had sat down with Trump to 're-open communications' with the president elect's team.\nThey had not had spoken with the former president in seven years.\n'For those asking why we would go speak with the president-elect during such fraught times, especially between us\u2026 I guess I would ask back: 'Why wouldn't we?',' Brzezinski said.\nAccording to her, she and Scarborough, both vocal critics of the president-elect, met with Trump because his decisive 2024 election victory called for a 'new approach.'\n'Joe and I realized it's time to do something different,' she said. 'And that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump, but also talking with him.'\nHaley however, told her followers on X that the co-hosts only decided to meet with Trump after 'They saw their ratings, They realized they needed Trump for their survival.'\nSeveral other fellow Republicans also criticized Morning Joe's Trump detente, calling the move hypocritical, considering the co-hosts, among other things, previously branded Trump as a fascist.\n'It's difficult to overstate how dishonest these two are,' former Trump staffer Steven Cortes posted on X.\nWhile what role ratings played in Scarborough and Brzezinski's decision remains unknown, MSNBC, the network that airs Morning Joe, has struggled with plummeting ratings since Trump's election.\nThe week after Election Day, the network saw a 39 percent drop in viewership compared to the network's October average, and primetime ratings declined 53 percent in viewership.",

        "excerpt": "Donald Trump hit the ground running with his transition to the White House ahead of Inauguration Day 2025.",
        "summary": "While Inauguration Day is still about two months away, Donald Trump has made swift announcements about some of his selections for members of his Cabinet and second administration.\nTwo weeks into his first presidential transition, Trump had only named three key people to his administration: the chief of staff, the attorney general and the ambassador to the United Nations, according to a timeline by Politico. Within the same time frame since this Election Day, he has named more than 10 Cabinet positions and a slate of other key positions within his administration.\nBut he won't be able to officially get to work for a couple of months. Here is what to know.\nWhen is Inauguration Day?\nTrump's inauguration is scheduled for Jan. 20, 2025 in Washington, D.C.\nPresidential transition news\nTrump has made rapid-fire announcements on who he wants in his administration.\nHere are some of the key positions he has named so far:\nChief of Staff: Trump named his senior campaign adviser Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, the first woman in history to hold the title. The Florida political consultant largely stays out of the spotlight, but has been credited with helping Trump's political comeback.\nAttorney General: Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has been nominated as the next attorney general overseeing the Justice Department, that he has long criticized.\nSecretary of State: Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is nominated as the next secretary of state. He will bring foreign policy experience through his roles in the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A Cuban-American, he is set to be the first Latino person to be secretary of state.\nDirector of National Intelligence: Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is nominated as the director of national intelligence. The former Democratic presidential candidate-turned Republican represented Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District from 2013-2021.\nDeputy chief of staff for policy: Long-standing Trump adviser Stephen Miller has been tapped for deputy chief of staff for policy in Trump's next administration. The 39-year-old served as senior adviser to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House and is credited with shaping Trump's immigration policies.\nAmbassador to the United Nations: Trump nominated Elise Stefanik, a five-term Republican representing a northern New York district, as his pick for UN ambassador. She is the House Republican Conference Chair and a former contender for Trump's running mate.\n'Border czar': Trump has appointed Tom Homan to oversee deportation policy and aviation security. Homan was a Border Patrol agent for 34 years and served in Trump's first administration as acting ICE director. He drew controversy for strict immigration enforcement, including the \"zero-tolerance\" policy which separated families of undocumented immigrants.\nEPA head: Trump has appointed Lee Zeldin as the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protective Agency. Zeldin was a Congressman for parts of Long Island, New York and ran but lost against Kathy Hochul in the 2022 gubernatorial race.\nNational security adviser: Trump has named Florida Rep. Mike Waltz as his national security adviser. Waltz has held civilian positions at the Pentagon, was on the House Armed Services Committee and has supported Trump's isolationist view of foreign relations.\nU.S. ambassador to Israel: Trump announced he is nominating former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as his U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is a Baptist minister and former Fox News host, who has run for the Republican presidential nomination twice, unsuccessfully. His daughter is Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as White House press secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency: Trump designated his former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe as CIA director. Ratcliffe previously was a House member from Texas before serving as director of national intelligence at the end of Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Defense: Trump nominated Fox News host Pete Hegseth to Defense secretary. A Fox News commentator, Hegseth served in the U.S. Army National Guard and had led veteran's advocacy groups.\nSecretary of Homeland Security: Trump announced his choice of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to be the secretary of Homeland Security. The pick puts the hardline conservative governor, who sent the state's National Guard to the southern border, in a key role on immigration.\nWhite House counsel: Trump tapped William McGinley to serve as his White House counsel. McGinley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm Holtzman Vogel, worked as White House Cabinet secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs: Trump named Doug Collins to be his secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins, a former congressman from 2013 to 2021 and trusted Trump loyalist, is a chaplain of the United States Air Force Reserve Command.\nSecretary of Interior: Trump named North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as his nominee for secretary of Interior. Burgum, a 68-year-old wealthy software executive, ran against Trump in the 2020 election but dropped out in December. As secretary for the Interior, he would oversee federal land and run programs involving native tribes.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services: Trump announced Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his pick to oversee the department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy ran as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump. He is known for his vaccine hesitancy and stance against fluoride in water, despite both being widely encouraged by medical professionals.\nDepartment of Government Efficiency: Trump named Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a newly created initiative to slash government spending. Trump's stated plan is for the department to advise from outside the government.\nTrump also visited Washington D.C. Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House and address congressional Republicans. Biden and Trump met for nearly two hours in a traditional meeting between the incoming and outgoing presidents that signifies the peaceful transition of power. Trump did not invite Biden to the White House in 2020.\nContributing: Greta Cross, Joey Garrison, Francesca Chambers",

        "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump nominated Fox host and former Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wisc., as secretary of transportation Monday, the latest nomination made by Trump as other positions such as secretary of the treasury remain unfilled.\nTrump has chosen people for a handful of Senate-confirmed Cabinet-level jobs, and he's picked a White House chief of staff, a communications director and a national security adviser, among the key roles that don't require confirmation.\nOne of the major unfilled positions remains treasury secretary, though Apollo Global Management CEO Mark Rowan and former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh are seen as contenders.\nTrump has announced a number of surprising and controversial picks, including former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., for attorney general, former Fox News host Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, for director of national intelligence, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services secretary.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text 'Alerts' to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\nTrump nominated former Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wisc., as secretary of transportation Monday, lauding his time in Congress and his role as a member of the House Financial Services Committee. Following his resignation from Congress in 2019, Duffy registered as a lobbyist and continued spending campaign funds on Trump's D.C. hotel. The campaign spent more than $22,000 at Trump's D.C. hotel between 2017 and 2020, $17,000 of which was spent in a single day in July 2019. Duffy is a co-host of Fox Business' 'The Bottom Line' and has contributed to Fox News since 2020. He is married to 'Fox & Friends Weekend' co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy.\nTrump hasn't nominated anyone yet, but Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan and former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh have emerged in recent days as potential picks. Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick and hedge fund executive Scott Bessent\u2014who spoke recently with Forbes\u2014have long been seen as the top choices, and are still in the mix, but Trump has reportedly grown frustrated with Lutnick's lobbying for the job. Elon Musk appeared to support Lutnick over Bessent, saying Bessent would be a 'business-as-usual choice' whereas Lutnick 'will actually enact change.' Trump is leaning toward someone with Wall Street experience, Bloomberg reported Monday. Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., former ambassador to Japan under Trump, is also on the speculative short list, along with former Trump-era U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and hedge fund executive Scott Bessent.\nTrump named Brendan Carr to chair the Federal Communications Commission on Sunday. Carr has served as one of the FCC's five commissioners since 2017, when Trump first appointed him to the agency. He's known as a critic of big tech companies, writing a chapter of the controversial Project 2025 agenda\u2014which Trump has broadly disavowed\u2014that argued the FCC should narrow the immunity enjoyed by tech platforms and require companies to be transparent about their content moderation decisions. He's also used his platform at the FCC to back billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk. He'll take over the FCC as Trump pushes the agency to revoke the licenses of broadcast TV stations whose coverage he claims is unfair\u2014though that could be very difficult in practice.\nChris Wright, chief executive of the oilfield services group Liberty Energy, was named Trump's nominee for secretary of energy. Wright has argued against climate change's role in causing extreme weather events, saying in a video posted to LinkedIn last year 'there is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either.' He later disputed he was '[fighting] climate science,' despite saying the claims he made were 'correct.'\nTrump tapped William Scharf to be an assistant to the president and the White House Staff Secretary. Scharf, who ran in the Republican primary in the race for Missouri's attorney general, was part of Trump's legal team that successfully argued he has immunity from official acts he took during his first term. He is a former assistant U.S. attorney who worked under former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens' administration between 2018 and Greitens' resignation in early 2019.\nKaroline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, will serve as White House Press Secretary once the president-elect assumes his office. Leavitt, 27, was an assistant press secretary during Trump's first presidency. She also won the Republican primary in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District in 2022, becoming the second Gen Z candidate to win a House primary.\nTrump picked his campaign spokesman, Steven Cheung, to serve as his communications director at the White House. Cheung was the director of communications for the president-elect's 2024 presidential campaign and served as director of strategic response during Trump's last term, after working in communications for the Ultimate Fighting Championship previously.\nTrump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department, making good on his promise to give Kennedy broad leeway over public health decisions. Kennedy, who ran for the Democratic nomination then as an independent candidate before dropping out and endorsing Trump, espouses debunked views on public health\u2014including skepticism about the efficacy of childhood vaccines and the Covid-19 vaccine. He has also advocated for removing fluoride from public water, an idea Trump said he as open to. As HHS secretary, Kennedy would oversee 13 public health-related agencies, and has expressed plans to upend many of them, telling an audience at a conference in November he would halt infectious disease studies at the National Institutes of Health if given a role in the Trump administration. 'I'm going to say to NIH scientists, God bless you all . . . thank you for your public service,' NBC reported. The appointment is another surprise pick by Trump, whose transition team co-chair Howard Lutnick told CNN late last month Kennedy wouldn't be in charge of HHS. The selection of Kennedy drew criticism from many Democrats, and some Republicans expressed wariness about the pick. Trump's former vice president Mike Pence spoke against Kennedy as the pick to lead HHS in a statement Friday and urged Senate Republicans to reject the nomination, citing Kennedy's support of abortion rights and saying, 'If confirmed, RFK, Jr. would be the most pro-abortion Republican appointed secretary of HHS in modern history.'\nTrump plans to nominate North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as secretary of the interior, he said at an event Thursday. If confirmed by the Senate, he'll be responsible for managing vast swaths of federally owned land, administering national parks and handling oil and gas drilling on federal property\u2014which Trump has vowed to ramp up. Trump also tapped Burgum as chairman of the new National Energy Council, which will cut down on regulations and 'oversee the path to U.S. ENERGY DOMINANCE,' according to Trump. The position will also provide Burgum a seat on the National Security Council. First elected North Dakota governor in 2016, Burgum briefly ran against Trump in the 2024 GOP primaries, but dropped out before the Iowa caucuses and endorsed Trump. A tech executive and investor by trade, Burgum previously ran Great Plains Software, remaining at the company after it was acquired by Microsoft. Last year, Forbes estimated his net worth at at least $100 million.\nTrump picked former Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., as his secretary for veterans affairs. Collins served as a congressman from 2013 to 2021, and was known as a vocal backer of Trump in the chamber during his first administration. He is also a chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command. Collins vowed Thursday to 'streamline and cut regulations in the VA, root out corruption, and ensure every veteran receives the benefits they've earned.' The former congressman was deployed to Iraq in 2008 as a member of the Air Force's 94th Airlift Wing.\nTrump tapped Dean John Sauer for solicitor general Thursday. Sauer has been credited with helping win Trump's presidential immunity case, which resulted in the Supreme Court ruling that presidents have some immunity for official acts they take in office. Sauer also served as solicitor general of Missouri for six years and clerked for late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\nTrump nominated former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, widely seen as one of the most prestigious prosecuting jobs due to the high-profile cases filed in the district, which includes New York City. He will presumably take over for Damien Williams, who has led the office for three years and brought charges against Sean 'Diddy' Combs, former Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell.\nTodd Blanche, Trump's hush money trial lawyer, was tapped as the president-elect's deputy attorney general. Blanche was lauded as 'an excellent attorney who will be a crucial leader in the Justice Department,' which Trump has often criticized throughout his criminal and civil cases. Blanche called the timing and location of Trump's hush money trial in New York unfair after the president-elect was convicted on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records.\nTrump picked attorney Emil Bove as his administration's principal associate deputy attorney general. Bove represented Trump alongside Blanche throughout the hush money trial and is a former federal prosecutor, having served as assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of New York for more than nine years. He was co-chief of the office's national security unit during his final two years.\nPresident and co-founder of Donald Trump Jr.'s Winning Team Publishing company, Sergio Gor, has been tapped to lead the Presidential Personnel Office.\nTrump said Wednesday he tapped Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., to serve as attorney general, a surprise appointment as Gaetz was not among the names commonly floated in media reports for the role. It's one of the most high-profile and highly anticipated appointments, as Trump has fiercely criticized the agency for prosecuting him and is expected to drastically change its makeup. Gaetz, who led the effort to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was investigated by the Department of Justice over allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, but the agency declined to prosecute him (Gaetz denied the accusation). The House Ethics Committee is also probing whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct or illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts or gave special privileges to friends, allegations he has repeatedly denied. Gaetz resigned from Congress a day after Trump announced him for the role and a day before the Ethics Committee was reportedly expected to vote whether to release a potentially damning report on its investigation into Gaetz's conduct. Gaetz's father, Don Gaetz, a former Florida state lawmaker who cofounded a hospice company, is worth about $33 million, largely due to real estate holdings.\nTrump announced Wednesday Tulsi Gabbard will serve as his Director of National Intelligence, a role that puts her at the head of the U.S. intelligence community. Gabbard is a former Democratic representative from Hawaii and a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, perhaps best-known for clashing with Kamala Harris on the debate stage in 2019. She left the party in 2022 and became an independent, before endorsing Trump in August and announcing she had joined the Republican Party. A critic of U.S. military interventions, Gabbard has drawn intense scrutiny for her foreign policy views, including for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2017.\nTrump announced Wednesday he nominated Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as secretary of state, confirming multiple reports earlier in the week that Trump was expected to tap the Florida senator for the top foreign policy job. Rubio and Trump feuded when they both ran for president in 2016, but the two smoothed over their relationship during Trump's most recent White House run. Rubio frequently campaigned for Trump and was said to be in the running to be his vice presidential pick. Some of Rubio's foreign policy stances break with Trump, including his co-sponsorship of legislation last year that would prohibit a president from exiting NATO without congressional approval. Rubio would be the first Latino to hold the position, which is subject to Senate confirmation. Forbes estimated Rubio's net worth at over $1 million on Wednesday\u2014significantly less than some other members of Trump's inner circle, but a jump since 2015, when he was worth just $100,000.\nTrump announced Wednesday former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino will return to his role, and also serve as an assistant to the president. Scavino, who worked as a senior adviser for Trump's most recent campaign and is a longtime Trump communications staffer, was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify in the House Jan. 6 committee investigation, but the Justice Department declined to prosecute him.\nTrump appointed his campaign political director James Blair to the position Wednesday. Blair spearheaded Trump's grassroots voter outreach efforts and made frequent media appearances during his most recent campaign.\nTrump announced Taylor Budowich, who ran the Trump-aligned MAGA Inc. super PAC before rejoining Trump's campaign in August, for the role on Wednesday. Budowich, a spokesperson for Trump's 2020 campaign, was called to testify in Trump's federal classified documents case and was also subpoenaed by the House Jan. 6 committee.\nTrump confirmed on Wednesday previous reports that he was expected to announce Stephen Miller as White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, plus the additional role of homeland security adviser. Miller was a senior adviser to Trump during his first administration and one of the architects of some of his most controversial immigration policies, including his family separation program.\nTrump announced Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person, will run a new Department of Government Efficiency (or 'DOGE') alongside investor and former Republican primary candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump said in a statement the department\u2014which has not yet been created\u2014will offer 'advice and guidance from outside of Government' and focus on 'making changes to the Federal Bureaucracy with an eye on efficiency,' including through spending and regulatory cuts. Musk, a vocal Trump backer who donated over $100 million to a pro-Trump super PAC, has pitched the department in the past, seemingly naming it after the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin.\nTrump selected Pete Hegseth as his secretary of defense, praising his status as a combat veteran and role as a co-host on Fox & Friends Weekend. Revelations subsequently emerged that Hegseth was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a Monterey, California, hotel in 2017. The Monterey Police Department confirmed in a statement that it investigated the incident, but did not bring charges. Hegseth has denied the allegations through his attorney, Timothy Parlatore, who told multiple outlets last week he paid his accuser a settlement to avoid a lawsuit over the matter.\nFormer Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe will serve as CIA director. A former Texas congressman, Ratcliffe served as the director of national intelligence from 2020 to 2021 and acted as Trump's primary intelligence adviser during his last presidency. During his time as director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe declassified unverified Russian intelligence information that claimed Hillary Clinton approved a plan to link Trump to Russia and the Democratic National Committee cyberattacks in 2016. Democrats criticized Ratcliffe's decision to publicly release the information, alleging he was politicizing unverified information to aid Trump.\nTrump picked former White House cabinet secretary and top GOP lawyer William McGinley as his White House Counsel. McGinley was brought into Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and tasked with helping it secure delegates for the Republican National Convention. He worked as Trump's White House cabinet secretary from 2017 to 2019 and was in charge of advising other cabinet members on policy coordination, optics and ethics, according to Politico.\nTrump tapped Steven Witkoff, a GOP donor and real estate investor, for special envoy to the Middle East. Witkoff is chairman of the University of Miami Business School Real Estate Advisory Board and the CEO of Witkoff, a real estate firm he founded in 1997. He is also a longtime friend of Trump's and one of the president-elect's golf partners. Witkoff was with Trump during the apparent second assassination attempt on his life, telling NBC that Secret Service agents dived on Trump and got him off his Florida golf course in under 20 seconds.\nTrump announced former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as his envoy to Israel last week, touting his military service as he served in the Army Special Forces for 27 years. Huckabee is a staunch supporter of Israel and has criticized the Biden administration's calls for a cease-fire with Hamas. Huckabee has advocated for Israel to annex parts of the West Bank, which Israel occupied in 1967, and has backed Israeli settlers in the territory. A former Southern Baptist pastor, Huckabee regularly leads evangelicals on visits to Israel.\nTrump appointed Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., to serve as his national security adviser. In recent months, Waltz\u2014a former Army Green Beret\u2014has frequently criticized China, urged NATO members to pay more for defense and said he expects Trump to push Ukraine and Russia toward a negotiated end to the war in Ukraine.\nTrump picked South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem for the role of secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, CNN reported early on Tuesday, citing two unnamed sources. Although no official announcement has been made, Noem is a long-time Trump loyalist who was believed be a contender for Vice President. The appointee will be essential in carrying out Trump's aggressive immigration plans, in addition to the agency's duties surrounding cybersecurity, antiterrorism and emergency response.\nTrump tapped former Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., to lead the EPA, citing his 'very strong legal background' and calling him 'a true fighter for America First policies' in a statement. Zeldin\u2014a Trump ally who ran for New York governor two years ago\u2014'will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American business while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards,' the statement said.\nTrump appointed his former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Tom Homan to newly created role, he announced Monday, as Trump plans a mass deportation of undocumented migrants during his second term.\nTrump nominated GOP Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., for the United Nations ambassador role, and she accepted the offer.\nTrump named his campaign co-manager Susie Wiles chief of staff two days after his election win, marking his first major administrative pick. Wiles will be the first woman to hold the position.\nTrump donor and former Uber executive Emil Michael, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., and former Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wisc., are in the running to lead the Department of Transportation, Reuters reported Saturday, citing eight unnamed sources familiar with the decision-making process. Graves told the outlet he would be honored to serve as DOT director and has been advising the Trump campaign on transportation and infrastructure issues. Michael is an investor in Musk's SpaceX company and socializes with the billionaire, according to Reuters.\nTrump's choice is unclear, but the agency's former leader, Betsy DeVos, said she would be willing to return to the role in a recent interview with Education Week. Trump has proposed dismantling the department and giving states control over their public schools.\nTrump is expected to name James Braid for the role advocating Trump's legislative agenda to lawmakers, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing unnamed sources. Braid is Vice President-elect Sen. JD Vance's former deputy chief of staff and worked in the Office of Management and Budget during Trump's first term. Trump has not announced his pick for the role.\nTrump decamped to Mar-a-Lago after his win last week, holding meetings with his inner circle, administration hopefuls and transition team to craft his second term agenda and build out his staff. Trump is shaping his second-term agenda with the help of several right-wing groups, his closest allies and billionaire backers. Musk, who has been spotted on numerous occasions at Mar-A-Lago since his election, is among those who appear to be influencing Trump's policy and personnel decisions. Lutnick is also overseeing a team making recommendations for personnel picks and vetting potential candidates, the Times reported, and Miller is expected to play a key role in making the final decisions. The right-wing think tank America First Policy Institute is reportedly the primary driver of Trump's transition plans and has been crafting possible executive actions for Trump once he takes office. The organization is chaired by former Trump Small Business Administration leader Linda McMahon and led by former Trump Domestic Policy Counsel Director Brook Rollins.\nWhat We Know About Trump's Potential Cabinet\u2014With RFK Jr. And Elon Musk Among The Candidates (Forbes)\nWho Will Help Shape Trump's Policy Agenda?

        "summary": "Morning Joe co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski visited Mar-a-Lago to meet President-elect Donald Trump, they revealed.\nScarborough and Brzezinski have been highly critical of Trump leading up to the election, calling him ' erratic,' slamming his election fraud efforts and warning of 'how dark of a place' the US would be if Trump won. But after airing their concerns with a second Trump presidency, the pair met with Trump Friday for the first time in seven years to 'restart communications.'\n'We talked about a lot of issues including abortion, mass deportations, threats of political retribution against political opponents and media outlets,' Scarborough said on Monday. 'It's gonna come as no surprise to anybody who watches this show\u2026that we didn't see eye to eye on a lot of issues and we told him so.'\nBrzezinski said: 'What we did agree on was to restart communications.'\nShe continued: 'We had not spoken to Trump since March of 2020, other than a personal call that Joe made after the attempt on his life in Butler, Pennsylvania.'\nDuring the meeting, the president-elect seemed ' cheerful' and 'upbeat' and 'interested in finding common ground with Democrats on some of the most divisive issues,' Brzezinski added.\nFor those wondering why they would meet with Trump at such a 'fraught' time, Brzezinski said she would reply: 'Why wouldn't we?'\n'Five years of political warfare has deeply divided Washington and the country,' she said.\nMorning Joe has been clear in expressing 'deep concerns' about Trump's 'actions and words,' but for nearly 80 million Americans, 'election denialism, public trials, January 6, were not as important as the issues that moved them to send Donald Trump back to the White House with their vote,' Brzezinski said.\nSo, the co-hosts realized they wanted to take a different approach today, she continued.\nScarborough tried to instill hope, adding that someone close to Trump told him over the weekend that since he's not seeking re-election this time around, 'maybe, just maybe now could be time for both parties to get to work.'\nGiven the tightness of the election, it 'seems to make sense for leaders of both parties to seek common ground if it's possible at all,' Scarborough said.\nThe pair spoke to top Democrats over the weekend as well, who signaled it was time for a new approach and that they were open to working with the president-elect if he's open to working with them, Scarborough explained.\nBut, they emphasized, threatening political opponents with arrest, harassment and even jail will not work.\n'We know this will be a consequential presidency. The question is whether it will be constructive,' Brzezinski said. 'It will take a new approach from all sides, from both parties, and a leader who will bring them together. Only time will tell if Donald Trump is that leader.'\nThe co-hosts made clear they will still push back on Trump when necessary.\n'Don't be mistaken,' Scarborough said. 'We are not here to defend or normalize Donald Trump. We are here to report on him and to hopefully provide you insights that are going to better equip all of us in understanding these deeply unsettling times.'",

Even after weeks of the election results, Trump is trending! Now it is not just the President-elect himself, the '\nTrump Dance\n' is taking over the globe and that's all one can see on social media nowadays.\nPresident-Elect Donald Trump's dance moves are gaining popularity around the world. Since his election, President-elect Donald Trump has become increasingly popular on Chinese social media platforms. Content featuring Trump, such as memes, inspirational quotes, and even dance videos, is circulating widely. A video is going viral on the social media where a Chinese groom enters the ceremony and performs the famous Trump's dance on 'YMCA' song.

        "excerpt": "Donald Trump nominated Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy and personal lawyer Will Scharf as a White House staff secretary.",
        "summary": "Republicans were on the defensive about two of President-elect Donald Trump's most controversial Cabinet picks Sunday.\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) said on CNN's State of the Union that a House Ethics Committee investigation into Trump's pick for attorney general and staunch Trump-loyalist Matt Gaetz should not be revealed. The Justice Department investigated sex trafficking allegations against Gaetz. The investigation ended without charges, but the House Ethics Committee continued to look into the allegation he assaulted a 17-year-old.\nAn attorney for Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice for Secretary of Defense, told multiple outlets that Hegseth paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017 because he feared losing his job at Fox News. Hegseth has denied the sexual assault allegation and was never charged, however he paid the woman as part of a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality provision after she threatened litigation in 2020, the attorney told media outlets.\nThough Trump did not add to his administration Sunday, the president-elect did name his choices for secretary of Energy and a prominent White House aide Saturday.\nTrump appointed personal lawyer Will Scharf, who played a key role in defending Trump in the federal criminal case tied to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, to be an assistant to the president and White House staff secretary. Scharf is the fourth personal attorney of Trump's to be named to the incoming administration.\nChris Wright to be nominated as Secretary of Energy\nTrump said Saturday he plans to nominate oil industry executive Chris Wright, CEO of Liberty Energy and 2024 campaign donor to lead the Department of Energy in his second term in the White House.\nThe department oversees the country's energy supplies, research and development of nuclear power, 17 national laboratories and the cleanup of Cold War-era nuclear efforts.\nWright will also be a member of Trump's newly-formed Council of National Energy, which is set to be led by Interior Secretary nominee Doug Burgum, the president-elect said in his statement.\nIn a video posted in 2023 on LinkedIn, Wright denied the scientific consensus that manmade greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for the warming planet.\n\"There is no climate crisis and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,\" said Wright, whose company counts among its services the hydraulic fracking technique used to extract natural gas and oil from deep below the Earth's surface.\nTrump's announcement is an indication that he intends to nominate Wright for Senate approval, however Trump has floated the demand that Republican Senate leadership allow for recess appointments as an end-around of the confirmation process.\nTrump's picks so far: What we know\nHere are Trump's picks for key positions in his administration, as of Sunday night.\nChief of Staff: Trump named his senior campaign adviser Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, the first woman in history to hold the title. The Florida political consultant largely stays out of the spotlight, but has been credited with helping Trump's political comeback.\nAttorney General: Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has been nominated as the next Attorney General overseeing the Justice Department, that he has long criticized.\nSecretary of State: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is nominated as the next Secretary of State. He will bring foreign policy experience through his roles in the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A Cuban-American, he is set to be the first Latino person to be Secretary of State.\nDirector of National Intelligence: Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is nominated as the director of national intelligence. The former Democratic presidential candidate-turned Republican represented Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District from 2013-2021.\nAmbassador to the United Nations: Trump nominated Elise Stefanik, a five-term Republican representing a northern New York district, as his pick for UN ambassador. She is the House Republican Conference Chair and a former contender for Trump's running mate.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services: Trump has named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The 2024 independent candidate has previously criticized vaccines and questioned the origin of the COVID-19 virus. He is arguably best known for spreading unfounded claims about a link between childhood vaccines and autism.\nSecretary of Defense: Trump nominated Fox News host Pete Hegseth to Defense secretary. A Fox News commentator, Hegseth served in the U.S. Army National Guard and had led veteran's advocacy groups.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator: Trump has appointed Lee Zeldin as the administrator of The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Zeldin was a Congressman for parts of Long Island, New York and ran but lost against Kathy Hochul in the 2022 gubernatorial race.\nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency: Trump designated his former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe as CIA director. Ratcliffe previously was a House member from Texas before serving as director of national intelligence at the end of Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Homeland Security: Trump announced his choice of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to be the Secretary of Homeland Security. The pick puts the hardline conservative governor, who sent the state's National Guard to the southern border, in a key role on immigration.\nSecretary of Interior: Trump has nominated Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to be his secretary of Interior coordinating federal policy to several territories. Burgum previously ran to be Republican presidential nominee before dropping out in December and has long been vocal about fossil fuels and energy issues.\nSecretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs: Trump has nominated former Republican U.S. Rep. Doug Collins to be his secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. He served as a congressman representing Georgia's 9th district from 2013 to 2021. A trusted Trump loyalist, he is a chaplain of the United States Air Force Reserve Command and served in the Iraq War in 2008.\nSecretary of the Department of Energy: Trump is nominating oil industry executive Chris Wright, CEO of Liberty Energy and 2024 campaign donor to lead the Department of Energy. Wright, who has expressed skepticism about climate change science, would join a Trump administration that campaigned to roll back climate change policies and clean energy spending ushered in during President Biden's term.\nDeputy chief of staff for policy: Long-standing Trump adviser Stephen Miller has been tapped for deputy chief of staff for policy in Trump's next administration. The 39-year-old served as senior adviser to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House and is credited with shaping Trump's immigration policies.\n'Border czar': Trump has appointed Tom Homan to oversee deportation policy and aviation security. Homan was a Border Patrol agent for 34 years and served in Trump's first administration as acting ICE director. He drew controversy for strict immigration enforcement, including the \"zero-tolerance\" policy which separated families of undocumented immigrants.\nNational security adviser: Trump has named Florida Rep. Mike Waltz as his national security adviser. Waltz has held civilian positions at the Pentagon, was on the House Armed Services Committee and has supported Trump's isolationist view of foreign relations.\nU.S. ambassador to Israel: Trump announced he is nominating former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as his U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is a Baptist minister and former Fox News host, who has run for the Republican presidential nomination twice, unsuccessfully. His daughter is Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as White House press secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nWhite House Counsel: Trump tapped William McGinley to serve as his White House counsel. McGinley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm Holtzman Vogel, worked as White House Cabinet secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nU.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York: Trump has nominated Jay Clayton as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Clayton has previously served as chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump's first term.\nDeputy attorney general: Trump has decided lawyer Todd Blanche will serve as deputy attorney general. Blanche is known for aggressively representing the president-elect in his New York hush money trial and in two federal criminal cases.\nWhite House Communications Director: Trump named Steven Cheung to be his communications director in his second term. Cheung worked as the rapid response director for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and was perhaps the most adversarial of the candidate's spokespersons, describing opponents and \"snowflakes\" and \"cucks\" who suffered from \"Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary: Trump named Karoline Leavitt as his second-term White House press secretary. She's expected to be the youngest to ever hold the position.\nWhat are the Cabinet positions?\nThe Cabinet advises the president on issues related to their respective offices.\nThese are the Cabinet positions from the 15 executive departments, which must be confirmed by the Senate:\nSecretary of State\nSecretary of Defense\nAttorney General\nSecretary of the Interior\nSecretary of Agriculture\nSecretary of Commerce\nSecretary of Labor\nSecretary of Health and Human Services\nSecretary of Transportation\nSecretary of Energy\nSecretary of Education\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs\nSecretary of Homeland Security\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\nSecretary of Treasury\nThe Cabinet and presidential advisers can also include the vice president, the chief of staff, the ambassador to the United Nations, the director of National Intelligence, the U.S. trade representative, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, the head of the Council of Economic Advisors, the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the head of the Small Business Administration.",

        "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump is filling key posts in his second administration, and it's shaping up much differently than his first. He's prioritizing loyalists for top jobs.\nTrump was bruised and hampered by internal squabbles during his initial term in office. Now he appears focused on remaking the federal government in his own image. Some of his choices could face difficult confirmation battles even with Republicans in control of the U.S. Senate.\nHere's a look at whom he has selected so far.\nCabinet nominees\nTrump named Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to be secretary of state, making the critic-turned-ally his choice for top diplomat.\nRubio, 53, is a noted hawk on China, Cuba and Iran, and was a finalist to be Trump's running mate on the Republican ticket last summer. Rubio is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n'He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,' Trump said of Rubio in a statement.\nThe announcement punctuates the hard pivot Rubio has made with Trump, whom the senator once called a 'con man' during his unsuccessful campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.\nTheir relationship improved dramatically while Trump was in the White House. And as Trump campaigned for the presidency a third time, Rubio cheered his proposals. For instance, Rubio, who more than a decade ago helped craft immigration legislation that included a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally, now supports Trump's plan to use the U.S. military for mass deportations.\nAttorney general: Matt Gaetz\nTrump said Wednesday he will nominate Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as his attorney general, naming a loyalist in the role of the nation's top prosecutor.\nIn selecting Gaetz, 42, Trump passed over some of the more established lawyers whose names had been mentioned as being contenders for the job.\n'Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and Restore Americans' badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department,' Trump said in a statement.\nGaetz resigned from Congress Wednesday night. The House Ethics Committee has been investigating an allegation that Gaetz paid for sex with a 17-year-old, though that probe effectively ended when he resigned. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.\nDirector of national intelligence: Tulsi Gabbard\nFormer Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has been tapped by Trump to be director of national intelligence, another example of Trump prizing loyalty over experience.\nGabbard, 43, was a Democratic House member who unsuccessfully sought the party's 2020 presidential nomination before leaving the party in 2022. She endorsed Trump in August and campaigned often with him this fall, and she's been accused of echoing Russian propaganda.\n'I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community,' Trump said in a statement.\nGabbard, who has served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, deploying to Iraq and Kuwait, would come to the role as an outsider compared to her predecessor. The current director, Avril Haines, was confirmed by the Senate in 2021 following several years in a number of top national security and intelligence positions.\nDefense secretary: Pete Hegseth\nHegseth, 44, is a co-host of Fox News Channel's 'Fox & Friends Weekend' and has been a contributor with the network since 2014. He developed a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on the show.\nHegseth served in the Army National Guard from 2002 to 2021, deploying to Iraq in 2005 and Afghanistan in 2011. He has two Bronze Stars. However, Hegseth lacks senior military and national security experience. If confirmed by the Senate, he would inherit the top job during a series of global crises \u2014 ranging from Russia's war in Ukraine and the ongoing attacks in the Middle East by Iranian proxies to the push for a cease-fire between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah and escalating worries about the growing alliance between Russia and North Korea.\nHegseth is also the author of 'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free,' published earlier this year.\nHomeland security secretary: Kristi Noem\nNoem is a well-known conservative used her two terms leading South Dakota to vault to a prominent position in Republican politics.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Noem did not order restrictions that other states had issued and instead declared her state 'open for business.' Trump held a fireworks rally at Mount Rushmore in July 2020 in one of the first large gatherings of the pandemic.\nMore recently, Noem faced sharp criticism for telling a story in her memoir about shooting and killing her dog.\nShe is set to lead a department crucial to the president-elect's hardline immigration agenda as well as other missions. Homeland Security oversees natural disaster response, the U.S. Secret Service and Transportation Security Administration agents who work at airports.\nCIA director: John Ratcliffe\nRatcliffe was director of national intelligence during the final year and a half of Trump's first term, leading the U.S. government's spy agencies during the coronavirus pandemic.\n'I look forward to John being the first person ever to serve in both of our Nation's highest Intelligence positions,' Trump said in a statement, calling him a 'fearless fighter for the Constitutional Rights of all Americans' who would ensure 'the Highest Levels of National Security, and PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.'\nHealth and human services secretary: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nKennedy ran for president as a Democrat, than as an independent, and then endorsed Trump. He's the son of Democratic icon Robert Kennedy, who was assassinated during his own presidential campaign.\nThe nomination of Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services alarmed people who are concerned about his record of spreading unfounded fears about vaccines. For example, he has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism.\nVeterans affairs secretary: Doug Collins\nCollins is a former Republican congressman from Georgia who gained recognition for defending Trump during his first impeachment trial, which centered on U.S. assistance for Ukraine. Trump was impeached for urging Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden in 2019 during the Democratic presidential nomination, but he was acquitted by the Senate.\nCollins has also served in the armed forces himself and is currently a chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command.\n'We must take care of our brave men and women in uniform, and Doug will be a great advocate for our Active Duty Servicemembers, Veterans, and Military Families to ensure they have the support they need,' Trump said in a statement about nominating Collins to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nInterior secretary: Doug Burgum\nThe governor of North Dakota, who was once little-known outside his state, Burgum is a former Republican presidential primary contender who endorsed Trump, and spent months traveling to drum up support for him, after dropping out of the race.\nBurgum was a serious contender to be Trump's vice presidential choice this summer. The two-term governor was seen as a possible pick because of his executive experience and business savvy. Burgum also has close ties to deep-pocketed energy industry CEOs.\nTrump made the announcement about Burgum joining his incoming administration while addressing a gala at his Mar-a-Lago club, and said a formal statement would be coming the following day.\nIn comments to reporters before Trump took the stage, Burgum said that, in recent years, the power grid is deteriorating in many parts of the country, which he said could raise national security concerns but also drive up prices enough to increase inflation.\n'There's just a sense of urgency, and a sense of understanding in the Trump administration,' Burgum said.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency administrator: Lee Zeldin\nZeldin does not appear to have any experience in environmental issues, but is a longtime supporter of the former president. The 44-year-old former U.S. House member from New York wrote on X, 'We will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI.'\n'We will do so while protecting access to clean air and water,' he added.\nDuring his campaign, Trump often attacked the Biden administration's promotion of electric vehicles, and incorrectly referred to a tax credit for EV purchases as a government mandate. Trump also often told his audiences during the campaign that his administration would 'drill, baby, drill,' referring to his support for expanded petroleum exploration.\nIn a statement, Trump said Zeldin 'will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet.'\nTransportation secretary: Sean Duffy\nDuffy is a former reality TV star who was one of Trump's most visible defenders on cable news \u2014 a prime concern for the media-focused president-elect. Duffy served in the House for nearly nine years, was a member of the Financial Services Committee and was chairman of the subcommittee on insurance and housing. He left Congress in 2019, and is now co-host of a show on Fox Business, the 'Bottom Line.'\nTrump said Duffy would use his experience and relationships built over the years in Congress 'to maintain and rebuild our Nation's Infrastructure, and fulfill our Mission of ushering in The Golden Age of Travel, focusing on Safety, Efficiency, and Innovation. Importantly, he will greatly elevate the Travel Experience for all Americans!'\nDuffy in 2022 ruled out a run for Wisconsin governor, despite pleas from Trump to make a bid, saying he needed time to care for the needs of his family of nine children, posting on social media that his youngest child had a heart condition.\nHe was featured on MTV's 'The Real World: Boston' in 1997, and he met his future wife on the set of MTV's 'Road Rules: All Stars' in 1998.\nWhite House staff\nChief of staff: Susie Wiles\nWiles, 67, was a senior adviser to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and its de facto manager.\nShe has a background in Florida politics, helping Ron DeSantis win his first race for Florida governor. Six years later, she was key to Trump's defeat of him in the 2024 Republican primary.\nWiles' hire was Trump's first major decision as president-elect and one that could be a defining test of his incoming administration considering her close relationship with him. Wiles is said to have earned Trump's trust in part by guiding what was the most disciplined of Trump's three presidential campaigns.\nWiles was able to help keep Trump on track as few others have, not by criticizing his impulses, but by winning his respect by demonstrating his success after taking her advice.\nNational security adviser: Mike Waltz\nWaltz is a three-term Republican congressman from east-central Florida. A former Army Green Beret, he served multiple tours in Afghanistan and also worked in the Pentagon as a policy adviser when Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates were defense chiefs.\nHe is considered hawkish on China, and called for a U.S. boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to its involvement in the origin of COVID-19 and its mistreatment of the minority Muslim Uighur population.\nBorder czar: Tom Homan\nHoman, 62, has been tasked with Trump's top priority of carrying out the largest deportation operation in the nation's history.\nHe served under Trump in his first administration leading U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and he was widely expected to be offered a position related to the border once Trump won the election. Homan said at a July conference in Washington that he would be willing to 'run the biggest deportation operation this country's ever seen.'\nDemocrats have criticized Homan for defending Trump's 'zero tolerance' policy on border crossings during his first administration, which led to the separation of thousands of parents and children seeking asylum at the border.\nDeputy chief of staff for policy: Stephen Miller\nMiller, an immigration hardliner, was a vocal spokesperson during the presidential campaign for Trump's priority of mass deportations. The 39-year-old was a senior adviser during Trump's first administration.\nMiller has been a central figure in some of Trump's policy decisions, notably his move to separate thousands of immigrant families. Trump argued throughout the campaign that the nation's economic, national security and social priorities could be met by deporting people who are in the United States illegally.\nSince Trump left office in 2021, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal, an organization made up of former Trump advisers aimed at challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as free speech and national security.\nDeputy chief of staff: Dan Scavino\nScavino was an adviser to all three of the president-elect's campaigns, and the transition team referred to him as one of 'Trump's longest serving and most trusted aides.' He will be deputy chief of staff and assistant to the president.\nHe previously ran Trump's social media profile in the White House during his first administration. He was also held in contempt of Congress in 2022 after a month-long refusal to comply with a subpoena from the House committee's investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\nDeputy chief of staff: James Blair\nBlair was political director for Trump's 2024 campaign and for the Republican National Committee. He will be deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs and assistant to the president.\nBlair was key to Trump's economic messaging during his winning White House comeback campaign this year, a driving force behind the candidate's 'Trump can fix it' slogan and his query to audiences this fall if they were better off than four years ago.\nDeputy chief of staff: Taylor Budowich\nBudowich is a veteran Trump campaign aide who launched and directed Make America Great Again, Inc., a super PAC that supported Trump's 2024 campaign. He will be deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel and assistant to the president.\nBudowich also had served as a spokesman for Trump after his first presidency.\nWhite House counsel: William McGinley\nMcGinley was White House Cabinet secretary during Trump's first administration, and was outside legal counsel for the Republican National Committee's election integrity effort during the 2024 campaign.\nIn a statement, Trump called McGinley 'a smart and tenacious lawyer who will help me advance our America First agenda, while fighting for election integrity and against the weaponization of law enforcement.'\nAmbassadors and envoys\nSpecial envoy to the Middle East: Steven Witkoff\nThe 67-year-old Witkoff is the president-elect's golf partner and was golfing with him at Trump's club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sept. 15, when the former president was the target of a second attempted assassination.\nWitkoff 'is a Highly Respected Leader in Business and Philanthropy,' Trump said of Witkoff in a statement. 'Steve will be an unrelenting Voice for PEACE, and make us all proud.'\nTrump also named Witkoff co-chair, with former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, of his inaugural committee.\nAmbassador to Israel: Mike Huckabee\nHuckabee is a staunch defender of Israel and his intended nomination comes as Trump has promised to align U.S. foreign policy more closely with Israel's interests as it wages wars against the Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah.\n'He loves Israel, and likewise the people of Israel love him,' Trump said in a statement. 'Mike will work tirelessly to bring about peace in the Middle East.'\nHuckabee, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination in 2008 and 2016, has been a popular figure among evangelical Christian conservatives, many of whom support Israel due to Old Testament writings that Jews are God's chosen people and that Israel is their rightful homeland.\nTrump has been praised by some in this important Republican voting bloc for moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\nHuckabee has rejected a Palestinian homeland in territory occupied by Israel, calling for a so-called 'one-state solution.'\nAmbassador to the United Nations: Elise Stefanik\nStefanik is a representative from New York and one of Trump's staunchest defenders going back to his first impeachment.\nElected to the House in 2014, Stefanik was selected by her GOP House colleagues as House Republican Conference chair in 2021, when former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from the post after publicly criticizing Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election. Stefanik, 40, has served in that role ever since as the third-ranking member of House leadership.\nStefanik's questioning of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses helped lead to two of those presidents resigning, further raising her national profile.\nIf confirmed, she would represent American interests at the U.N. as Trump vows to end the war waged by Russia against Ukraine that began in 2022.",

        "summary": "Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski are restarting communications with President-elect Donald Trump.\nThe hosts of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" revealed Monday that they met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Friday, which Brzezinski noted was the \"first time we have seen him in seven years.\" She said they had also not spoken to Trump at all since March 2020, other than a phone call Scarborough made to the former president after he survived an assassination attempt in July.\n\"In this meeting, President Trump was cheerful, he was upbeat, he seemed interested in finding common ground with Democrats on some of the most divisive issues,\" Brzezinski said. \"And for those asking why we would go speak to the president-elect during such fraught times, especially between us, I guess I would ask back, 'Why wouldn't we?'\"\nAccording to Scarborough, topics in the meeting included \"abortion, mass deportations,\" and \"threats of political retribution against political opponents and media outlets,\" and he said it should come as no surprise that they \"didn't see eye to eye on a lot of issues.\"\nMorning Joe' hosts Joe Scarborough,Mika Brzezinski are married; get the details\nNeed a break?

In December 2016, Scarborough told Politico that they \"talk to Trump a few times a week.\"\nJoe Scarboroughcriticizes MSNBC for taking 'Morning Joe' off-air Monday: 'Very disappointed'\nBut their relationship took a turn after Trump assumed office as the MSNBC hosts increasingly took issue with his actions as president and as Trump attacked the \"crazy\" and \"psycho\" hosts on social media.

        "excerpt": "Donald Trump hit the ground running with his transition to the White House ahead of Inauguration Day 2025.",
        "summary": "While Inauguration Day is still about two months away, Donald Trump has made swift announcements about some of his selections for members of his Cabinet and second administration.\nTwo weeks into his first presidential transition, Trump had only named three key people to his administration: the chief of staff, the attorney general and the ambassador to the United Nations, according to a timeline by Politico. Within the same time frame since this Election Day, he has named more than 10 Cabinet positions and a slate of other key positions within his administration.\nBut he won't be able to officially get to work for a couple of months. Here is what to know.\nWhen is Inauguration Day?\nTrump's inauguration is scheduled for Jan. 20, 2025 in Washington, D.C.\nPresidential transition news\nTrump has made rapid-fire announcements on who he wants in his administration.\nHere are some of the key positions he has named so far:\nChief of Staff: Trump named his senior campaign adviser Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, the first woman in history to hold the title. The Florida political consultant largely stays out of the spotlight, but has been credited with helping Trump's political comeback.\nAttorney General: Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has been nominated as the next attorney general overseeing the Justice Department, that he has long criticized.\nSecretary of State: Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is nominated as the next secretary of state. He will bring foreign policy experience through his roles in the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A Cuban-American, he is set to be the first Latino person to be secretary of state.\nDirector of National Intelligence: Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is nominated as the director of national intelligence. The former Democratic presidential candidate-turned Republican represented Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District from 2013-2021.\nDeputy chief of staff for policy: Long-standing Trump adviser Stephen Miller has been tapped for deputy chief of staff for policy in Trump's next administration. The 39-year-old served as senior adviser to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House and is credited with shaping Trump's immigration policies.\nAmbassador to the United Nations: Trump nominated Elise Stefanik, a five-term Republican representing a northern New York district, as his pick for UN ambassador. She is the House Republican Conference Chair and a former contender for Trump's running mate.\n'Border czar': Trump has appointed Tom Homan to oversee deportation policy and aviation security. Homan was a Border Patrol agent for 34 years and served in Trump's first administration as acting ICE director. He drew controversy for strict immigration enforcement, including the \"zero-tolerance\" policy which separated families of undocumented immigrants.\nEPA head: Trump has appointed Lee Zeldin as the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protective Agency. Zeldin was a Congressman for parts of Long Island, New York and ran but lost against Kathy Hochul in the 2022 gubernatorial race.\nNational security adviser: Trump has named Florida Rep. Mike Waltz as his national security adviser. Waltz has held civilian positions at the Pentagon, was on the House Armed Services Committee and has supported Trump's isolationist view of foreign relations.\nU.S. ambassador to Israel: Trump announced he is nominating former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as his U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is a Baptist minister and former Fox News host, who has run for the Republican presidential nomination twice, unsuccessfully. His daughter is Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as White House press secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency: Trump designated his former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe as CIA director. Ratcliffe previously was a House member from Texas before serving as director of national intelligence at the end of Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Defense: Trump nominated Fox News host Pete Hegseth to Defense secretary. A Fox News commentator, Hegseth served in the U.S. Army National Guard and had led veteran's advocacy groups.\nSecretary of Homeland Security: Trump announced his choice of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to be the secretary of Homeland Security. The pick puts the hardline conservative governor, who sent the state's National Guard to the southern border, in a key role on immigration.\nWhite House counsel: Trump tapped William McGinley to serve as his White House counsel. McGinley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm Holtzman Vogel, worked as White House Cabinet secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs: Trump named Doug Collins to be his secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins, a former congressman from 2013 to 2021 and trusted Trump loyalist, is a chaplain of the United States Air Force Reserve Command.\nSecretary of Interior: Trump named North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as his nominee for secretary of Interior. Burgum, a 68-year-old wealthy software executive, ran against Trump in the 2020 election but dropped out in December. As secretary for the Interior, he would oversee federal land and run programs involving native tribes.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services: Trump announced Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his pick to oversee the department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy ran as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump. He is known for his vaccine hesitancy and stance against fluoride in water, despite both being widely encouraged by medical professionals.\nDepartment of Government Efficiency: Trump named Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a newly created initiative to slash government spending. Trump's stated plan is for the department to advise from outside the government.\nTrump also visited Washington D.C. Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House and address congressional Republicans. Biden and Trump met for nearly two hours in a traditional meeting between the incoming and outgoing presidents that signifies the peaceful transition of power. Trump did not invite Biden to the White House in 2020.\nContributing: Greta Cross, Joey Garrison, Francesca Chambers",

        "excerpt": "With president-elect likely to use DoJ to crush enemies, only hope lies in staffers refusing to carry out illegal orders",
        "summary": "As Donald Trump moves fast to expand his influence over prosecutorial and legal decisions while revamping the US justice department, concerns are rising quickly about how he may abuse his powers to target political foes for 'retribution' as he often suggested during his campaign, say ex-federal prosecutors.\nFueling those fears was the president-elect's stunning decision to choose ultra-loyalist and firebrand Florida representative Matt Gaetz to be his attorney general and help fight what Trump calls a 'weaponized government' that he says baselessly used a special counsel to file criminal charges against him for trying to subvert his 2020 election loss.\nTrump's pick of Gaetz quickly set off alarm bells among former DoJ officials and some congressional Republicans who view him as unfit due to ethics and legal problems that for years have dogged Gaetz, and could seriously jeopardize his confirmation by the Senate.\nAbove all, the choice of Gaetz underscores the premium Trump places on selecting a loyalist who can help him expand his powers at the DoJ to further his revenge agenda, and avoid the conflicts Trump had at times with Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr when they were attorneys general in his first administration.\n'It's an extraordinary choice,' said former DoJ inspector general Michael Bromwich. 'In a world where there are plenty of lawyers willing to do Trump's bidding, he chooses the candidate who has so much baggage. He's testing his strength and if anyone in his party has the backbone to oppose him.\n[Matt Gaetz] is an extraordinary choice. [Trump is] testing his strength and if anyone in his party has the backbone to oppose him\nMichael Bromwich, former DoJ inspector general\n'Gaetz will not be able to obtain a security clearance because of the sex-trafficking criminal investigation that was finally closed a year ago, the ongoing House ethics committee investigation, and other acts of mischief. It's hard to imagine he is capable of being confirmed even with a Republican majority in the Senate.'\nSimilarly, Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University and an ex-federal prosecutor, deplored Trump's choice of Gaetz. 'Trump's selection of him shows a contempt for the department that is sure to lead those within it, particularly in the DC area, to think hard about whether they can bear to stay,' he said.\nBut in tapping Gaetz, Trump lavishly praised him, declaring he 'will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans' badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department'.\nFurther, Trump's picking Gaetz jibed with older concerns about Trump's debunked claims he was the victim of a vendetta and 'lawfare' led by the special counsel Jack Smith, who filed criminal charges against Trump for conspiring to subvert his 2020 loss and for improperly taking hundreds of classified documents after he left office.\nTrump and his lawyers have vehemently denied Smith's charges.\nLast month, Trump said he'd fire Smith in 'two seconds' and that Smith ought to be 'thrown out of the country'. Likewise, Trump's multibillionaire ally Elon Musk said Smith ' cannot go unpunished', and the House judiciary chair, Jim Jordan, has warned Smith to 'preserve everything' and suggested investigations could be coming.\nSmith is now in the process of winding down his two investigations and planning to leave his post before Trump takes office in January given that Gaetz would almost certainly move to drop the cases at Trump's request, say ex-DoJ prosecutors.\nCompounding concerns about Trump's plans to exert more influence at the DoJ was the US supreme court's highly controversial ruling on 1 July that granted presidents wide-ranging immunity from prosecution for their 'official' acts.\nCritics worry too that the rule of law and DoJ will be badly weakened in light of Trump's often calling those convicted of crimes for their violent actions during the January 6 insurrection to block the certification of Biden's win 'patriots', and suggested that he would grant many pardons when he takes office.\nIn another sign on Thursday that Trump is moving aggressively to overhaul the DoJ, he tapped Todd Blanche, the key lawyer who defended him against the Smith charges and the 34 counts of business fraud that he was convicted on in New York, to be deputy attorney general.\nEx-DoJ officials say Trump risks violating historical standards of independence with his threats to punish his political enemies who besides Smith include Biden, the ex-House speaker Nancy Pelosi and others.\n'Trump's revenge agenda is utterly inconsistent with the Department of Justice's standards for initiating investigations and prosecutions,' said Bromwich. 'Anyone in DoJ who implements that agenda would violate not only historical practice but specific DoJ requirements embodied in its internal regulations.\n'Although they might curry favor with the White House, they would subject themselves to misconduct investigations within DoJ \u2013 unless that function is neutered \u2013 and risk the loss of their license to practice law.'\nIn a related vein, Bromwich warned: 'There is no doubt that the Republican Congress will be willing accomplices in the pursuit of Trump's enemies, including people who investigated and prosecuted him. The saving grace is the incompetence of the investigators who demonstrated their ineptness \u2013 over and over again \u2013 in pursuing the impeachment of President Biden and various other wild goose chases.'\nOther ex-prosecutors worry Trump now may move aggressively to target his political foes given the supreme court ruling this year that handed presidents broad immunity for their official acts.\n'I have concerns about a Trump administration in which he now enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution,' said Barbara McQuade, a former top prosecutor in the eastern district of Michigan who now teaches law at the University of Michigan. 'An order by Trump to his attorney general to prosecute his rivals would be barred from prosecution,' giving Trump a freer hand to target his foes.\nMcQuade noted: 'Even a loyalist attorney general can't prosecute a case without assistants. I am hopeful that career professionals at DoJ would refuse to carry out illegal orders [and] that could result in their resignations or firings, and then replacement by people who are willing to obey. '\nMcQuade stressed too: 'After Watergate, the justice department installed norms designed to protect it from partisan influence. Gaetz seems determined to take a sledgehammer to those norms.'\nRichman worries Jordan and other Trump allies could try to undermine DoJ independence to further Trump's revenge agenda and bring law enforcement personnel to testify before Congress on their past actions under the Biden administration. 'Should this happen \u2013 and it may start with Jack Smith and the career prosecutors who worked with him \u2013 the damage to department morale and effectiveness will be grievous,' he said.\nMeanwhile, it's not clear what will happen with Smith's extensive work documenting his charges against Trump for conspiring to overturn his loss in 2020 and leaving office with a large cache of classified documents\nSmith is reportedly working on a final report about his findings in the two federal cases charging Trump with criminal conduct to submit to Merrick Garland, which the attorney general has the option of making public before he leaves office.\nSmith also faces a decision about whether to indict any of the co-conspirators who were unnamed but widely identified in the election-subversion case, although any Trump allies he charged would very likely get presidential pardons, say ex-prosecutors.\nIn another legal area, critics say that if Trump goes ahead with granting many presidential pardons to January 6 insurrectionists as he's suggested, that would be very damaging to the rule of law and DoJ morale. While Trump has hedged at times about just how many people he would pardon of the more than 1,500 convicted of crimes for taking part in the violent attack on the Capitol, he told a CNN town hall in May 2023: 'I am inclined to pardon many of them.'\n'I am concerned that he may recklessly and contemptuously pardon the most serious of the January 6 perpetrators despite their insurrection and violence,' Ty Cobb, a former Trump White House lawyer and ex-DoJ official, said.\nCobb said he was concerned about Trump's overhaul of the DoJ and what the Gaetz pick portends. 'I'm concerned about the integrity of the entire department given the Gaetz appointment. Vengeance for Trump and further violence to the rule of law beyond what Trump's crimes to date have seen are the desired consequences of having Gaetz as AG,' he said.",

        "excerpt": "Donald Trump nominated Chris Wright to head the Department of Energy and personal lawyer Will Scharf as a White House staff secretary.",
        "summary": "Republicans were on the defensive about two of President-elect Donald Trump's most controversial Cabinet picks Sunday.\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) said on CNN's State of the Union that a House Ethics Committee investigation into Trump's pick for attorney general and staunch Trump-loyalist Matt Gaetz should not be revealed. The Justice Department investigated sex trafficking allegations against Gaetz. The investigation ended without charges, but the House Ethics Committee continued to look into the allegation he assaulted a 17-year-old.\nAn attorney for Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice for Secretary of Defense, told multiple outlets that Hegseth paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017 because he feared losing his job at Fox News. Hegseth has denied the sexual assault allegation and was never charged, however he paid the woman as part of a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality provision after she threatened litigation in 2020, the attorney told media outlets.\nThough Trump did not add to his administration Sunday, the president-elect did name his choices for secretary of Energy and a prominent White House aide Saturday.\nTrump appointed personal lawyer Will Scharf, who played a key role in defending Trump in the federal criminal case tied to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, to be an assistant to the president and White House staff secretary. Scharf is the fourth personal attorney of Trump's to be named to the incoming administration.\nChris Wright to be nominated as Secretary of Energy\nTrump said Saturday he plans to nominate oil industry executive Chris Wright, CEO of Liberty Energy and 2024 campaign donor to lead the Department of Energy in his second term in the White House.\nThe department oversees the country's energy supplies, research and development of nuclear power, 17 national laboratories and the cleanup of Cold War-era nuclear efforts.\nWright will also be a member of Trump's newly-formed Council of National Energy, which is set to be led by Interior Secretary nominee Doug Burgum, the president-elect said in his statement.\nIn a video posted in 2023 on LinkedIn, Wright denied the scientific consensus that manmade greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for the warming planet.\n\"There is no climate crisis and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,\" said Wright, whose company counts among its services the hydraulic fracking technique used to extract natural gas and oil from deep below the Earth's surface.\nTrump's announcement is an indication that he intends to nominate Wright for Senate approval, however Trump has floated the demand that Republican Senate leadership allow for recess appointments as an end-around of the confirmation process.\nTrump's picks so far: What we know\nHere are Trump's picks for key positions in his administration, as of Sunday night.\nChief of Staff: Trump named his senior campaign adviser Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, the first woman in history to hold the title. The Florida political consultant largely stays out of the spotlight, but has been credited with helping Trump's political comeback.\nAttorney General: Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has been nominated as the next Attorney General overseeing the Justice Department, that he has long criticized.\nSecretary of State: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is nominated as the next Secretary of State. He will bring foreign policy experience through his roles in the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A Cuban-American, he is set to be the first Latino person to be Secretary of State.\nDirector of National Intelligence: Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is nominated as the director of national intelligence. The former Democratic presidential candidate-turned Republican represented Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District from 2013-2021.\nAmbassador to the United Nations: Trump nominated Elise Stefanik, a five-term Republican representing a northern New York district, as his pick for UN ambassador. She is the House Republican Conference Chair and a former contender for Trump's running mate.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services: Trump has named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The 2024 independent candidate has previously criticized vaccines and questioned the origin of the COVID-19 virus. He is arguably best known for spreading unfounded claims about a link between childhood vaccines and autism.\nSecretary of Defense: Trump nominated Fox News host Pete Hegseth to Defense secretary. A Fox News commentator, Hegseth served in the U.S. Army National Guard and had led veteran's advocacy groups.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator: Trump has appointed Lee Zeldin as the administrator of The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Zeldin was a Congressman for parts of Long Island, New York and ran but lost against Kathy Hochul in the 2022 gubernatorial race.\nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency: Trump designated his former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe as CIA director. Ratcliffe previously was a House member from Texas before serving as director of national intelligence at the end of Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Homeland Security: Trump announced his choice of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to be the Secretary of Homeland Security. The pick puts the hardline conservative governor, who sent the state's National Guard to the southern border, in a key role on immigration.\nSecretary of Interior: Trump has nominated Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to be his secretary of Interior coordinating federal policy to several territories. Burgum previously ran to be Republican presidential nominee before dropping out in December and has long been vocal about fossil fuels and energy issues.\nSecretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs: Trump has nominated former Republican U.S. Rep. Doug Collins to be his secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. He served as a congressman representing Georgia's 9th district from 2013 to 2021. A trusted Trump loyalist, he is a chaplain of the United States Air Force Reserve Command and served in the Iraq War in 2008.\nSecretary of the Department of Energy: Trump is nominating oil industry executive Chris Wright, CEO of Liberty Energy and 2024 campaign donor to lead the Department of Energy. Wright, who has expressed skepticism about climate change science, would join a Trump administration that campaigned to roll back climate change policies and clean energy spending ushered in during President Biden's term.\nDeputy chief of staff for policy: Long-standing Trump adviser Stephen Miller has been tapped for deputy chief of staff for policy in Trump's next administration. The 39-year-old served as senior adviser to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House and is credited with shaping Trump's immigration policies.\n'Border czar': Trump has appointed Tom Homan to oversee deportation policy and aviation security. Homan was a Border Patrol agent for 34 years and served in Trump's first administration as acting ICE director. He drew controversy for strict immigration enforcement, including the \"zero-tolerance\" policy which separated families of undocumented immigrants.\nNational security adviser: Trump has named Florida Rep. Mike Waltz as his national security adviser. Waltz has held civilian positions at the Pentagon, was on the House Armed Services Committee and has supported Trump's isolationist view of foreign relations.\nU.S. ambassador to Israel: Trump announced he is nominating former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as his U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is a Baptist minister and former Fox News host, who has run for the Republican presidential nomination twice, unsuccessfully. His daughter is Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as White House press secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nWhite House Counsel: Trump tapped William McGinley to serve as his White House counsel. McGinley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm Holtzman Vogel, worked as White House Cabinet secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nU.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York: Trump has nominated Jay Clayton as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Clayton has previously served as chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump's first term.\nDeputy attorney general: Trump has decided lawyer Todd Blanche will serve as deputy attorney general. Blanche is known for aggressively representing the president-elect in his New York hush money trial and in two federal criminal cases.\nWhite House Communications Director: Trump named Steven Cheung to be his communications director in his second term. Cheung worked as the rapid response director for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and was perhaps the most adversarial of the candidate's spokespersons, describing opponents and \"snowflakes\" and \"cucks\" who suffered from \"Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary: Trump named Karoline Leavitt as his second-term White House press secretary. She's expected to be the youngest to ever hold the position.\nWhat are the Cabinet positions?\nThe Cabinet advises the president on issues related to their respective offices.\nThese are the Cabinet positions from the 15 executive departments, which must be confirmed by the Senate:\nSecretary of State\nSecretary of Defense\nAttorney General\nSecretary of the Interior\nSecretary of Agriculture\nSecretary of Commerce\nSecretary of Labor\nSecretary of Health and Human Services\nSecretary of Transportation\nSecretary of Energy\nSecretary of Education\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs\nSecretary of Homeland Security\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\nSecretary of Treasury\nThe Cabinet and presidential advisers can also include the vice president, the chief of staff, the ambassador to the United Nations, the director of National Intelligence, the U.S. trade representative, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, the head of the Council of Economic Advisors, the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the head of the Small Business Administration.\nContributing: Zac Anderson, Darren Samuelsohn, Karen Weintraub, Alyssa Goldberg, Tom Vanden Brook, David Jackson, Savannah Kuchar, Victor Hagan, Bart Jansen, Fernando Cervantes Jr., Riley Beggin, Michael Collins, Joey Garrison; Kaycee Sloan, Cincinnati Enquirer.",

        "summary": "Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, longtime co-hosts of MSNBC's Morning Joe , made a shocking announcement on Monday. After years of not engaging with Donald Trump, the duo went down to Mar-a-Lago to meet with the President-elect. 'Joe and I realized it's time to do something different,' Brzezinski said. 'And that starts with not only talking about Donald Trump, but also talking with him.'\nThe pair's visit to Trump headquarters marked the first time that Brzezinski and Scarborough had seen the President-elect in person in seven years, according to Brzezinski. They had also not spoken to Trump directly since March of 2020, aside from a short call Scarborough had made to Trump following the assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally, according to the Monday segment.\nScarborough noted that they spoke to Trump about a multitude of concerns, including abortion, immigration, and political retribution, to which he said, 'We didn't see eye to eye on a lot of issues.' However, what they did agree on, was the decision to 'restart communications' between the two camps. Brzezinski also challenged those who will likely question why the pair willingly met with Trump after covering him so ruthlessly throughout his administration and beyond, saying 'Why wouldn't we,' pointing to 'five years of political warfare,' which has divided Washington significantly.\nBrzezinski referenced her father, the late diplomat Zbigniew Brzezinski, noting that he spoke with world leaders 'he and the United States profoundly disagreed,' a 'task shared by reporters and commentators alike.'\nWhile the pair were close with Trump during his first run for office in 2016, the relationship eroded significantly as the former president attacked Brzezinski repeatedly while in office. On social media, Trump referred to Brzezinski as 'low I.Q. Crazy Mika' and claimed in a series of posts that she had been 'bleeding badly from a face-lift' at a social event held at Mar-a-Lago in 2017. Trump even promoted a conspiracy theory that Scarborough had committed murder, a line of attack the host called 'extraordinarily cruel.'\nNews of the Morning Joe hosts d\u00e9tente with Trump comes as MSNBC has struggled with cratering ratings following the election of Trump earlier this month, and amid questions about whether there will be a similar appetite for 'resistance' media as there was in Trump's first term.\nThe week following Election Day, the cable network saw a 39% decline in viewership compared to the network's average in October. And primetime ratings saw an even more significant decline, dropping 53% in viewership, according to Nielsen figures.",

He is known for his vaccine hesitancy and stance against fluoride in water, despite both being widely encouraged by medical professionals.\nDepartment of Government Efficiency: Trump named Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a newly created initiative to slash government spending. Trump's stated plan is for the department to advise from outside the government.\nTrump also visited Washington D.C. Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House and address congressional Republicans. Biden and Trump met for nearly two hours in a traditional meeting between the incoming and outgoing presidents that signifies the peaceful transition of power. Trump did not invite Biden to the White House in 2020.\nContributing: Greta Cross, Joey Garrison, Francesca Chambers",

        "summary": "It was less than seven years ago that then-president Donald Trump aggressively took on the NFL when players took a knee during the national anthem in protest of racism and police brutality. Oh, how times have changed.\nJust under two weeks after he was elected the 47th president of the United States, Trump was all over the NFL in Week 11 without actually attending a game. Multiple sports personalities emulated the dance moves he displayed at his campaign rallies, with the UFC's Jon Jones perhaps serving as inspiration after his Trump-themed celebration in front of the president-elect on Saturday.\nThat doesn't mean opposition to Trump doesn't exist in the sports world anymore; plenty of athletes and coaches, including the NBA's Steve Kerr and Doc Rivers, will tell you that's far from the truth. The weekend certainly signaled a bit of a culture shift, though, and some big names are getting in on the fun.\nHere's what you need to know about Trump's famous dance and why it's taking over the sports world.\nNFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule\nDonald Trump dance, explained\nTrump has often closed his rallies by dancing to \"YMCA\" over his last two presidential campaigns, first breaking out the moves on a regular basis during the outdoor rallies that defined the 2020 campaign.\nThe dance is pretty simple, which is no surprise considering Trump is in his 70s. The president-elect pumps his fists back and forth to the music, though he's occasionally tossed in a new move here and there; he added a golf swing to his routine at some rallies late in the 2024 campaign.\nTrump's dance gained attention on social media throughout the 2024 campaign, and it's evidently broken through to mainstream culture if the sports world is any indication. It seemed contagious over the weekend, starting with Jones' dance right in front of Trump after UFC 309 at Madison Square Garden on Saturday.\nAfter 49ers DE Nick Bosa broke out the dance moves in Week 10, four players did the Trump dance on Sunday: Raiders TE Brock Bowers, Titans WR Calvin Ridley and Lions pass-rushers Za'Darius Smith and Malcolm Rodriguez.\nHere's a look at each of the dances.\nMORE: Updated NFL power rankings after Week 11\nAthletes doing the Donald Trump dance\nJones did an especially animated version of Trump's dance in front of the man himself after defeating Stipe Miocic at UFC 309, also giving the president-elect a thumbs-up.\nJon Jones did the Trump dance after knocking down and beating Stipe Miocic \ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/Bv719AjIf0 \u2014 FearBuck (@FearedBuck) November 17, 2024\nRaiders rookie Brock Bowers hit the Trump dance after a touchdown against the Dolphins, though the team ended his media availability when he was asked about it after the game.\nBrock Bowers did the Donald Trump dance after scoring a TD. pic.twitter.com/NLMwKl2U0G \u2014 Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) November 17, 2024\nTitans WR Calvin Ridley did the dance after what he thought was a long touchdown against the Vikings, prompting celebration from Team Trump, but the score would be negated by a penalty.\nAND THE VIKINGS-TITANS GAME!\nTHE TRUMP DANCE CAN'T BE STOPPED! pic.twitter.com/FIuQOwFWeV \u2014 Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) November 17, 2024\nZa'Darius Smith hit the Trump dance in his first game with the Lions.

I'm proud to be a Christian American champion,' Jones said in his post-fight interview.\nThis latest Trump foray into sports is a far cry from just seven years ago when Trump accused NFL players of disrespecting the American flag by kneeling during the National Anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice.\nNow, NFL athletes are being reposted and shared on the social media accounts of the 45th and 47th president.\nNick Bosa hit the Donald Trump dance after a sack pic.twitter.com/OeLZj0WMXY\n\u2014 Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) November 10, 2024\nSan Francisco 49ers edge rusher Nick Bosa started the Trump dance trend in the NFL during his Nov. 10 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, celebrating a sack with teammates Leonard Floyd, Sam Okuayinonu and Fred Warner.\nBosa's dance earned him a shoutout from Trump on social media network Truth Social.\n'I think you know the answer to that question,' Bosa told the San Francisco Chronicle last week when asked his inspiration for the Trump dance. 'All the guys wanted me to do it. I wasn't even going to do it, but the boys reminded me. And it was fun.'\nWest Virginia's Nicco Marchiol also had his Trump dance posted by Trump on social media on Nov. 12.\nDrake University's Trey Radocha, Northern Illinois University's Tristen Tewes and University of Texas defender Michael Taaffee have also celebrated with Trump dances during games. East Carolina quarterback Katin Houser may have started the trend in college with his celebration two days after the Nov. 5 election.\nIt's no surprise the Trump dance has become viral. As much as the 78-year-old Trump has been divisive when it comes to politics, he's been ingrained in pop culture for much of his life.\nThe Trump dance is challenging the political idea of athletes not 'sticking to sports' with a silly dance that's seems to be sticking around.",

        "excerpt": "He may have reached 'uncle status' with Trump's granddaughter Kai, but Musk has already started to fall out with the people surrounding the president-elect. That hasn't stopped him continuing to push to influence Cabinet picks, however",
        "summary": "Lawmakers and policy shops have largely moved on from the shock of Kamala Harris 's defeat and are preparing for Donald Trump 's return to the city in January.\nJoe Biden was among those who seemed to have made peace with the outcome over the past few days. Now firmly in the 'lame duck' stage of his presidency, the president spent the weekend in South America, participating in the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro.\nMeanwhile, the race to fill Trump's remaining Cabinet positions fell under the shadow of the newest member of the president-elect's entourage: Elon Musk.\nThe Twitter/X CEO \u2014 who now travels with Trump frequently and hangs around Mar-a-Lago when not \u2014 is using his massive platform and his access to the president-elect in an attempt to shape the incoming administration.\nOn Saturday, his latest effort took form as he endorsed Howard Lutnick, Trump's transition team co-chair, for the position of Treasury Secretary. Lutnick's key competitor for the job, Scott Bessent, had auditioned for the job just a day prior. That makes the timing of Musk's endorsement look extremely convenient.\nAnd there's more. CNN reports Musk has been 'weighing in on staffing decisions \u2013 making clear his preference for certain roles'. And Axios reported on Monday about a blow-up between Musk and Boris Epshteyn, one of the president-elect's longtime close advisers. According to the news outlet, Musk angrily accused the Trump loyalist of leaking to the media about other Cabinet nominations and accused Epshteyn of having too much influence over Trump. What was described as a 'huge explosion' played out in front of Mar-a-Lago guests and club members, according to the report.\nEpshteyn isn't saying a word publicly on the matter, and declined to comment when asked by The Independent about it. His silence comes as other Republican insiders say that talking to the press has been strongly discouraged among those jockeying for government positions in Trumpworld.\nA number of Trump's Cabinet positions remain open besides Treasury, which is one of the biggest remaining prizes. Others include the department heads at Education, Commerce, Labor, Transportation, and HUD, as well as Trump's new chief trade representative.\nThere are still opportunities for Trump to cause serious disruption with his imminent picks. Many are eyeing the Education Department to see whether the president-elect will install someone who believes it should be abolished \u2014 someone like Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice, one of the candidates seen in the running. Her organization has led the purges of LGBTQ+ books and other materials from school libraries, enraging progressives and some free speech advocates.\nCommerce, on the other hand, is likely to be one of his least controversial picks. The president-elect is reported to be leaning towards Linda McMahon, former CEO of WWE, to lead the department; McMahon served as the head of his Small Business Administration without scandal during his first presidency.\nOne big question concerns Trump's pick for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). He's widely expected to fire Lina Khan, the Biden appointee (who has made an enemy of Musk), but her work has won some allies in Trump's inner circle, including JD Vance. Her replacement may well follow in her footsteps.\nThere are signs, too, that Elon Musk's influence in Trump's inner circle may be far from ironclad. A pair of articles over Sunday and Monday from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal indicated that Musk's endorsement of Lutnick only served to reinforce Trump's discomfort with Lutnick's heavy-handed lobbying for the nomination, and revealed that two new candidates had entered consideration for the job: former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh and Apollo Global Management chief executive Marc Rowan.\nOther reports have indicated that Trump's inner circle is increasingly growing frustrated with Musk's weaseling his way into MAGAworld to the point where he was ordained as having made 'uncle status' by Kai Trump, Donald Trump Jr.'s daughter. Musk's presence at Mar-a-Lago, typically dining with Trump or joining the president-elect on golfing excursions, has worn thin on high-ranking aides. Even Trump himself has joked about Musk latching on to his re-election campaign and post-election transition.\n'He likes this place. I can't get him out of here. He just likes this place,' Trump quipped last week. 'And you know what? I like having him here, too.'\nThe Tesla chief is still expected to lead the so-called 'Department of Government Efficiency' under Trump's second presidency, which is likely to just be a White House advisory council with a fancy title.\nBut if Musk keeps on making enemies, his access to the president-elect may end up like one of his rockets \u2014 exploding before it ever leaves the launchpad.",

        "excerpt": "Trump was originally believed to have two frontrunners in Howard Lutnick and Scott Bessent, but is now reported to be considering more options.",
        "summary": "Last week, Trump was said to be deciding between two leading candidates for Treasury Secretary.\nReports say Trump has been having second thoughts and is expanding his search to four major prospects.\nKevin Warsh and Marc Rowan have also been named as possible contenders.\nTwo weeks after securing his return to the White House, president-elect Donald Trump has swiftly been forming his Cabinet for 2025.\nTrump already announced six of the people he wants to lead the 15 executive departments, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for the Department of Health and Human Services and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for the State Department.\nHe appears to be taking a slower pace as he chooses his nominated successor to Janet Yellen, the current Secretary of the Treasury.\nThe new Treasury Secretary will likely have two immediate tasks: Helping the US avoid default when the national debt ceiling expires in January 2025 and extending the 2017 Trump tax cut, which is worth trillions and is mostly set to expire next year.\nThe president-elect was initially said to be considering just two candidates, but The Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported that he's been having second thoughts and expanded the list to four prospects.\nWith Trump seemingly still unsure over his choice, it's also possible that another candidate may emerge.\nHere are the top picks Trump is reportedly now considering for Secretary of the Treasury. A press contact for Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from BI.\nKevin Warsh\nKevin Warsh, center, is rising as one of the candidates for Trump's Treasury Secretary.for Semafor\nWarsh, 54, is a former Morgan Stanley banker and one of the newer contenders.\nHe was an economic advisor to President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2006 and a governor of the Federal Reserve Board from 2006 to 2011. During the latter period, Warsh was a central figure in shaping the nation's response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis, working to rescue major ailing banks.\nMore recently, he's been working on Trump's transition team, helping with economic policy and personnel, according to The Journal.\nWarsh appears to have been in the president-elect's good graces for several years. Axios reported that Trump praised Warsh as a \"really handsome guy\" when the two met in 2017 at the White House.\nTrump had been floating Warsh that year as a frontrunner for Fed chair. He eventually picked Jerome Powell for the role.\nWarsh is often seen as a financial hawk, saying in October that he believed the Fed \"doesn't seem to have a serious theory of inflation\" and writing in July that it moved too slowly to curb surging prices.\nIn his July commentary, he blamed inflation on \"irresponsible government spending and excessive money printing.\" Warsh has also been critical of America's burgeoning debt.\nMarc Rowan\nMarc Rowan isn't said to be actively lobbying for Treasury Secretary, but his aides have reportedly been in touch with the Trump administration.\nPETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images\nRowan, 62, is a billionaire investor who leads Apollo Global Management, which he cofounded in the 1990s. It now has nearly $700 billion in assets under management. Apollo recently announced that it plans to double its assets under management to $1.5 trillion by 2029.\nThe Journal and the Times reported that Rowan, like Warsh, is one of Trump's new candidates.\nThe Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that while the billionaire's aides are in touch with Trump, Rowan isn't actively trying to secure the Treasury Secretary role and hasn't spoken to Trump personally about such a position.\nBut the Times also wrote that Trump has been telling his staff that he's impressed with Rowan, who Bloomberg estimates to be worth $10.9 billion.\nRowan has said that US economic concerns must be fixed by what he called \"wholesale change,\" which he said Trump and his new administration would bring.\nThat's broadly in line with how Trump has framed his Cabinet picks, as key movers who will upset the status quo and push fresh reform.\nRowan has kept a relatively low profile on his views about government policy, though he recently voiced concerns that the Fed could overstimulate the economy with interest rate cuts.\nHoward Lutnick\nHoward Lutnick spoke for Trump at Madison Square Garden and praised a time when the US was reliant on tariffs instead of income tax.\nANGELA WEISS / AFP\nLutnick, 63, is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a Wall Street financial services firm.\nLutnick has been serving as Trump's transition cochair with Linda McMahon, of WWE royalty. He's been a friend of the president-elect for decades, repeatedly holding fundraisers for Trump.\nIn August, Lutnick hosted an event at his home in the Hamptons that raised $15 million for the Trump-Vance campaign.\nLutnick has aligned himself closely with Trump's rhetoric. In late October, he expressed a vision for the US economy, describing America in the year 1900 to a crowd at Madison Square Garden, saying it was a time when the \"economy was rocking.\"\n\"We had no income tax, and all we had was tariffs,\" he said to a cheering stadium.\nLutnick has also said that under Trump, corporate taxes would be raised for US giants like Apple and Tesla. He said that Elon Musk, a Trump ally, welcomed such a move if it applied to all big players. Musk has endorsed Lutnick for Treasury Secretary.\nLutnick is also known for steering Cantor Fitzgerald after the 9/11 attack, which killed 658 of its 960 employees at the World Trade Center.\nScott Bessent\nScott Bessent is the founder of macro investment firm Key Square Capital Management.Bessent, 62, was one of the original frontrunners for Trump's Treasury Secretary.\nHis involvement emerged early last week when Reuters reported that the founder of macro investment firm Key Square Capital Management had been meeting with Trump at the Mar-a-Lago resort.\nBessent worked for the liberal philanthropist George Soros from 1991 to 2015, making a name for himself by betting big against the British pound, which collapsed in 1992, and then against the Japanese yen as it weakened in 2013.\nHe left Soros' firm in 2015 to start Key Square, and The Journal reported that he hasn't spoken to the billionaire in years.\nBessent has been vocal in his support for Trump, telling Breitbart in August that Vice President Kamala Harris would have crashed the economy if she was president.\nHe wrote an opinion column just after the election, praising Trump for a stock market rally after his win and knocking 23 Nobel Prize-winning economists for predicting that the president-elect's agenda would be \"counterproductive.\"\nThe investor laid out his ideas for the economy in his written piece, calling for the Trump administration to reduce government borrowing and to reform President Joe Biden's policies for investment in a \"quixotic energy transition.\"\nLike Lutnick, he's advocated for an economy that's more reliant on tariffs and weaned off income tax, saying the move would restore America's position on the world stage and help curb China's growth.\nHowever, The Journal reported that some conservatives in Trump's circle were concerned about Bessent's past experience working for Soros, who has attracted the ire of the MAGA base for his support of left-leaning causes.\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

        "excerpt": "Donald Trump hit the ground running with his transition to the White House ahead of Inauguration Day 2025.",
        "summary": "While Inauguration Day is still about two months away, Donald Trump has made swift announcements about some of his selections for members of his Cabinet and second administration.\nTwo weeks into his first presidential transition, Trump had only named three key people to his administration: the chief of staff, the attorney general and the ambassador to the United Nations, according to a timeline by Politico. Within the same time frame since this Election Day, he has named more than 10 Cabinet positions and a slate of other key positions within his administration.\nBut he won't be able to officially get to work for a couple of months. Here is what to know.\nWhen is Inauguration Day?\nTrump's inauguration is scheduled for Jan. 20, 2025 in Washington, D.C.\nPresidential transition news\nTrump has made rapid-fire announcements on who he wants in his administration.\nHere are some of the key positions he has named so far:\nChief of Staff: Trump named his senior campaign adviser Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, the first woman in history to hold the title. The Florida political consultant largely stays out of the spotlight, but has been credited with helping Trump's political comeback.\nAttorney General: Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has been nominated as the next attorney general overseeing the Justice Department, that he has long criticized.\nSecretary of State: Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is nominated as the next secretary of state. He will bring foreign policy experience through his roles in the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A Cuban-American, he is set to be the first Latino person to be secretary of state.\nDirector of National Intelligence: Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is nominated as the director of national intelligence. The former Democratic presidential candidate-turned Republican represented Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District from 2013-2021.\nDeputy chief of staff for policy: Long-standing Trump adviser Stephen Miller has been tapped for deputy chief of staff for policy in Trump's next administration. The 39-year-old served as senior adviser to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House and is credited with shaping Trump's immigration policies.\nAmbassador to the United Nations: Trump nominated Elise Stefanik, a five-term Republican representing a northern New York district, as his pick for UN ambassador. She is the House Republican Conference Chair and a former contender for Trump's running mate.\n'Border czar': Trump has appointed Tom Homan to oversee deportation policy and aviation security. Homan was a Border Patrol agent for 34 years and served in Trump's first administration as acting ICE director. He drew controversy for strict immigration enforcement, including the \"zero-tolerance\" policy which separated families of undocumented immigrants.\nEPA head: Trump has appointed Lee Zeldin as the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protective Agency. Zeldin was a Congressman for parts of Long Island, New York and ran but lost against Kathy Hochul in the 2022 gubernatorial race.\nNational security adviser: Trump has named Florida Rep. Mike Waltz as his national security adviser. Waltz has held civilian positions at the Pentagon, was on the House Armed Services Committee and has supported Trump's isolationist view of foreign relations.\nU.S. ambassador to Israel: Trump announced he is nominating former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as his U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is a Baptist minister and former Fox News host, who has run for the Republican presidential nomination twice, unsuccessfully. His daughter is Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as White House press secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency: Trump designated his former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe as CIA director. Ratcliffe previously was a House member from Texas before serving as director of national intelligence at the end of Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Defense: Trump nominated Fox News host Pete Hegseth to Defense secretary. A Fox News commentator, Hegseth served in the U.S. Army National Guard and had led veteran's advocacy groups.\nSecretary of Homeland Security: Trump announced his choice of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to be the secretary of Homeland Security. The pick puts the hardline conservative governor, who sent the state's National Guard to the southern border, in a key role on immigration.\nWhite House counsel: Trump tapped William McGinley to serve as his White House counsel. McGinley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm Holtzman Vogel, worked as White House Cabinet secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs: Trump named Doug Collins to be his secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins, a former congressman from 2013 to 2021 and trusted Trump loyalist, is a chaplain of the United States Air Force Reserve Command.\nSecretary of Interior: Trump named North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum as his nominee for secretary of Interior. Burgum, a 68-year-old wealthy software executive, ran against Trump in the 2020 election but dropped out in December. As secretary for the Interior, he would oversee federal land and run programs involving native tribes.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services: Trump announced Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his pick to oversee the department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy ran as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump. He is known for his vaccine hesitancy and stance against fluoride in water, despite both being widely encouraged by medical professionals.\nDepartment of Government Efficiency: Trump named Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a newly created initiative to slash government spending. Trump's stated plan is for the department to advise from outside the government.\nTrump also visited Washington D.C. Wednesday to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House and address congressional Republicans. Biden and Trump met for nearly two hours in a traditional meeting between the incoming and outgoing presidents that signifies the peaceful transition of power. Trump did not invite Biden to the White House in 2020.",

        "summary": "Republicans were on the defensive about two of President-elect Donald Trump's most controversial Cabinet picks Sunday.\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) said on CNN's State of the Union that a House Ethics Committee investigation into Trump's pick for attorney general and staunch Trump-loyalist Matt Gaetz should not be revealed. The Justice Department investigated sex trafficking allegations against Gaetz. The investigation ended without charges, but the House Ethics Committee continued to look into the allegation he assaulted a 17-year-old.\nAn attorney for Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice for Secretary of Defense, told multiple outlets that Hegseth paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017 because he feared losing his job at Fox News. Hegseth has denied the sexual assault allegation and was never charged, however he paid the woman as part of a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality provision after she threatened litigation in 2020, the attorney told media outlets.\nThough Trump did not add to his administration Sunday, the president-elect did name his choices for secretary of Energy and a prominent White House aide Saturday.\nTrump appointed personal lawyer Will Scharf, who played a key role in defending Trump in the federal criminal case tied to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, to be an assistant to the president and White House staff secretary. Scharf is the fourth personal attorney of Trump's to be named to the incoming administration.\nChris Wright to be nominated as Secretary of Energy\nTrump said Saturday he plans to nominate oil industry executive Chris Wright, CEO of Liberty Energy and 2024 campaign donor to lead the Department of Energy in his second term in the White House.\nThe department oversees the country's energy supplies, research and development of nuclear power, 17 national laboratories and the cleanup of Cold War-era nuclear efforts.\nWright will also be a member of Trump's newly-formed Council of National Energy, which is set to be led by Interior Secretary nominee Doug Burgum, the president-elect said in his statement.\nIn a video posted in 2023 on LinkedIn, Wright denied the scientific consensus that manmade greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for the warming planet.\n\"There is no climate crisis and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,\" said Wright, whose company counts among its services the hydraulic fracking technique used to extract natural gas and oil from deep below the Earth's surface.\nTrump's announcement is an indication that he intends to nominate Wright for Senate approval, however Trump has floated the demand that Republican Senate leadership allow for recess appointments as an end-around of the confirmation process.\nTrump's picks so far: What we know\nHere are Trump's picks for key positions in his administration, as of Sunday night.\nChief of Staff: Trump named his senior campaign adviser Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, the first woman in history to hold the title. The Florida political consultant largely stays out of the spotlight, but has been credited with helping Trump's political comeback.\nAttorney General: Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has been nominated as the next Attorney General overseeing the Justice Department, that he has long criticized.\nSecretary of State: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is nominated as the next Secretary of State. He will bring foreign policy experience through his roles in the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A Cuban-American, he is set to be the first Latino person to be Secretary of State.\nDirector of National Intelligence: Former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is nominated as the director of national intelligence. The former Democratic presidential candidate-turned Republican represented Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District from 2013-2021.\nAmbassador to the United Nations: Trump nominated Elise Stefanik, a five-term Republican representing a northern New York district, as his pick for UN ambassador. She is the House Republican Conference Chair and a former contender for Trump's running mate.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services: Trump has named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The 2024 independent candidate has previously criticized vaccines and questioned the origin of the COVID-19 virus. He is arguably best known for spreading unfounded claims about a link between childhood vaccines and autism.\nSecretary of Defense: Trump nominated Fox News host Pete Hegseth to Defense secretary. A Fox News commentator, Hegseth served in the U.S. Army National Guard and had led veteran's advocacy groups.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator: Trump has appointed Lee Zeldin as the administrator of The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Zeldin was a Congressman for parts of Long Island, New York and ran but lost against Kathy Hochul in the 2022 gubernatorial race.\nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency: Trump designated his former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe as CIA director. Ratcliffe previously was a House member from Texas before serving as director of national intelligence at the end of Trump's first presidency.\nSecretary of Homeland Security: Trump announced his choice of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to be the Secretary of Homeland Security. The pick puts the hardline conservative governor, who sent the state's National Guard to the southern border, in a key role on immigration.\nSecretary of Interior: Trump has nominated Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to be his secretary of Interior coordinating federal policy to several territories. Burgum previously ran to be Republican presidential nominee before dropping out in December and has long been vocal about fossil fuels and energy issues.\nSecretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs: Trump has nominated former Republican U.S. Rep. Doug Collins to be his secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. He served as a congressman representing Georgia's 9th district from 2013 to 2021. A trusted Trump loyalist, he is a chaplain of the United States Air Force Reserve Command and served in the Iraq War in 2008.\nSecretary of the Department of Energy: Trump is nominating oil industry executive Chris Wright, CEO of Liberty Energy and 2024 campaign donor to lead the Department of Energy. Wright, who has expressed skepticism about climate change science, would join a Trump administration that campaigned to roll back climate change policies and clean energy spending ushered in during President Biden's term.\nDeputy chief of staff for policy: Long-standing Trump adviser Stephen Miller has been tapped for deputy chief of staff for policy in Trump's next administration. The 39-year-old served as senior adviser to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House and is credited with shaping Trump's immigration policies.\n'Border czar': Trump has appointed Tom Homan to oversee deportation policy and aviation security. Homan was a Border Patrol agent for 34 years and served in Trump's first administration as acting ICE director. He drew controversy for strict immigration enforcement, including the \"zero-tolerance\" policy which separated families of undocumented immigrants.\nNational security adviser: Trump has named Florida Rep. Mike Waltz as his national security adviser. Waltz has held civilian positions at the Pentagon, was on the House Armed Services Committee and has supported Trump's isolationist view of foreign relations.\nU.S. ambassador to Israel: Trump announced he is nominating former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as his U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is a Baptist minister and former Fox News host, who has run for the Republican presidential nomination twice, unsuccessfully. His daughter is Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as White House press secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nWhite House Counsel: Trump tapped William McGinley to serve as his White House counsel. McGinley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm Holtzman Vogel, worked as White House Cabinet secretary during Trump's first presidency.\nU.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York: Trump has nominated Jay Clayton as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Clayton has previously served as chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump's first term.\nDeputy attorney general: Trump has decided lawyer Todd Blanche will serve as deputy attorney general. Blanche is known for aggressively representing the president-elect in his New York hush money trial and in two federal criminal cases.\nWhite House Communications Director: Trump named Steven Cheung to be his communications director in his second term. Cheung worked as the rapid response director for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and was perhaps the most adversarial of the candidate's spokespersons, describing opponents and \"snowflakes\" and \"cucks\" who suffered from \"Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary: Trump named Karoline Leavitt as his second-term White House press secretary. She's expected to be the youngest to ever hold the position.\nWhat are the Cabinet positions?\nThe Cabinet advises the president on issues related to their respective offices.\nThese are the Cabinet positions from the 15 executive departments, which must be confirmed by the Senate:\nSecretary of State\nSecretary of Defense\nAttorney General\nSecretary of the Interior\nSecretary of Agriculture\nSecretary of Commerce\nSecretary of Labor\nSecretary of Health and Human Services\nSecretary of Transportation\nSecretary of Energy\nSecretary of Education\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs\nSecretary of Homeland Security\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\nSecretary of Treasury\nThe Cabinet and presidential advisers can also include the vice president, the chief of staff, the ambassador to the United Nations, the director of National Intelligence, the U.S. trade representative, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, the head of the Council of Economic Advisors, the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the head of the Small Business Administration.",
