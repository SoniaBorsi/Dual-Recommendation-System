# Real-Time News Feed Aggregator with Clustering by Ideology & Topic

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a real-time news aggregator that groups news articles by topic and ideology, providing users with an organized and ideologically diverse view of the news landscape. Using clustering and distance measures, the aggregator will offer categorized news feeds that reflect various perspectives, enabling more nuanced consumption of information.

## Methodology:
The project will collect real-time news articles from multiple sources using APIs and process them using PySpark, allowing for efficient handling of large datasets. MapReduce will serve as the foundation for processing and parallelizing the clustering of news articles based on similarities in content and ideological markers.

## Key methodologies include:

**Distance Measures**: Similarity measures (such as cosine and Jaccard) will quantify how closely related articles are in terms of topic or ideological leanings, helping to establish clusters.

**Clustering**: The primary clustering algorithm will categorize articles into topic or ideological clusters, enabling quick grouping and access to similar articles.

**Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**: LSH will efficiently group similar articles together, aiding in clustering while managing the high-dimensional data typical of text content.

## Additional Tools and Techniques (if feasible):

**Graph-Based Clustering**: For ideological clustering, we may explore graph-based clustering to analyze relationships between articles based on citation networks or shared themes.

**PageRank**: Implementing PageRank can help assign an importance score to each article or source, allowing users to identify high-impact news within each topic or ideological cluster.

**Shingling and Minhashing**: These will be employed to identify near-duplicate content and to detect articles that share substantial portions of text, which can further refine clusters.

**Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques such as PCA may be used to reduce the dimensionality of our text vectors, allowing for more efficient clustering.

## Implementation Stack:
**Data Collection**: NewsCatcher News API https://newscatcherapi.com/ for real-time news feed updates.
**Data Processing and Aggregation**: PySpark and MapReduce for distributed processing and clustering.
**Storage and Dockerization**: Docker for containerized deployments, enabling scalability and reproducibility across environments.
**Visualization**: The clustered articles and ideological/topic distributions will be visualized using Plotly for a user-friendly interface.

## Expected Outcomes:
This project aims to create a robust, real-time system for aggregating news articles and clustering them by topic and ideology, helping users access a balanced and structured news feed. The system will allow users to identify trending topics and see news articles categorized by ideological perspectives, thus promoting a more comprehensive understanding of global news narratives.




## Summary of TO DO's
- Store each article in MongoDB with metadata (each article in a separate document, documents organized in collections based on tipic or geographical region idk)
- Preprocess each articleâ€™s text (tokenization, stop word removal, etc.).
- Combine fields into a single text for richer input.
- Vectorize using TF-IDF or Word2Vec (choose based on clustering needs).
- Store vectors in MongoDB for easy access and further processing.
- Cluster articles by topic using k-means or another clustering algorithm.
- Use cosine similarity to retrieve articles similar to a given one within the same or related topics.
